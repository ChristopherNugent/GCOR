The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced `` no evidence '' that any irregularities took place . 
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee , which had over-all charge of the election , `` deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta '' for the manner in which the election was conducted . 
The September-October term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible `` irregularities '' in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr. . 
`` Only a relative handful of such reports was received '' , the jury said , `` considering the widespread interest in the election , the number of voters and the size of this city '' . 
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' . 
It recommended that Fulton legislators act `` to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them '' . 
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics , among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments '' . 
Merger proposed 
However , the jury said it believes `` these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration '' . 
The City Purchasing Department , the jury said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies '' . 
It urged that the city `` take steps to remedy '' this problem . 
Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury . 
It urged that the next Legislature `` provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected '' . 
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes . 
`` This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program '' , the jury said , but the State Welfare Department `` has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County , which receives none of this money . 
The jurors said they realize `` a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties '' . 
Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds '' , the jurors said . 
`` Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden '' on Fulton taxpayers . 
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers , guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation . 
Wards protected 
The jury said it found the court `` has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations '' of two previous grand juries , the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee . 
`` These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms '' , the jury said . 
Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport , the jury recommended `` that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences '' . 
The jury did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable '' . 
Ask jail deputies 
On other matters , the jury recommended that : ( 1 ) 
Four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and `` a doctor , medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail '' . 
( 2 ) 
Fulton legislators `` work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable '' pension plan for city employes . 
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department , the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office , the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms , Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department . 
Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife , Pearl Williams Hartsfield , in Fulton Superior Court Friday . 
His petition charged mental cruelty . 
The couple was married Aug. 2 , 1913 . 
They have a son , William Berry Jr. , and a daughter , Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin . 
Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon . 
The petition listed the mayor's occupation as `` attorney '' and his age as 71 . 
It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika , Ala. . 
The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year . 
The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. Aj . 
Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney . 
Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta , with exception of one brief interlude , since 1937 . 
His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923 . 
The mayor's present term of office expires Jan. 1 . 
He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr. , who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection . 
Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race , a top official said Wednesday . 
Robert Snodgrass , state GOP chairman , said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience . 
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker . 
In the Blue Ridge meeting , the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters . 
Despite the warning , there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate , according to Republicans who attended . 
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race , it voted no -- and there were no dissents . 
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race , one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 
Five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot , or 2 
The Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform . 
Sam Caldwell , State Highway Department public relations director , resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's campaign . 
Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time . 
He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville , who has been an assistant more than three years . 
When the gubernatorial campaign starts , Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd . 
The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly . 
Before adjournment Monday afternoon , the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made . 
Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment . 
Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item . 
Construction bonds 
Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds . 
The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act , and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways . 
A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work . 
A revolving fund 
The department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities . 
Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin . 
The Highway Department source told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds . 
Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances . 
Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the `` quickie '' vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought . 
While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out , Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31 . 
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5 . 
As of Sunday night , there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action . 
Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions . 
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education , something it has consistently opposed in the past . 
Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to `` endorse increased federal support for public education , provided that such funds be received and expended '' as state funds . 
Barber , who is in his 13th year as a legislator , said there `` are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed '' . 
But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution . 
The resolution , which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday , will be formally read Monday . 
It says that `` in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds '' , the State Board of Education should be directed to `` give priority '' to teacher pay raises . 
Colquitt 
-- After a long , hot controversy , Miller County has a new school superintendent , elected , as a policeman put it , in the `` coolest election I ever saw in this county '' . 
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis , a veteran agriculture teacher , who defeated Felix Bush , a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee . 
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election , and Bush got 402 . 
Ordinary Carey Williams , armed with a pistol , stood by at the polls to insure order . 
`` This was the coolest , calmest election I ever saw '' , Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said . 
`` Being at the polls was just like being at church . 
I didn't smell a drop of liquor , and we didn't have a bit of trouble '' . 
The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet , however . 
It was marked by controversy , anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence . 
The former county school superintendent , George P. Callan , shot himself to death March 18 , four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board . 
During the election campaign , both candidates , Davis and Bush , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls . 
Ordinary Williams said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election . 
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls , and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election . 
Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise . 
`` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff said . 
`` There wasn't a bit of trouble '' . 
Austin , Texas 
-- Committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's `` abandoned property '' act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers . 
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures , in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation . 
Under committee rules , it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week . 
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it . 
Daniel termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31 . 
He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books `` since Texas was a republic '' . 
It permits the state to take over bank accounts , stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more . 
The bill , which Daniel said he drafted personally , would force banks , insurance firms , pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer . 
The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property , Daniel declared . 
Dewey Lawrence , a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association , sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers . 
`` If you destroy confidence in banks , you do something to the economy '' , he said . 
`` You take out of circulation many millions of dollars '' . 
Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman , sponsor of the bill , said a failure to enact it would amount `` to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks , insurance and pipeline companies '' . 
His contention was denied by several bankers , including Scott Hudson of Sherman , Gaynor B. Jones of Houston , J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin . 
Cox argued that the bill is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts . 
He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing , since the bill was introduced only last Monday . 
Austin , Texas 
-- Senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties . 
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state . 
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House . 
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population , require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here . 
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas , Harris , Bexar , Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500 , which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed , Parkhouse told the Senate . 
The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County , saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school . 
Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff . 
While details are still to be worked out , Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected . 
`` We're getting more ' pro ' letters than ' con ' on horse race betting '' , said Ratcliff . 
`` But I believe if people were better informed on this question , most of them would oppose it also . 
I'm willing to stake my political career on it '' . 
Rep. Berry , an ex-gambler from San Antonio , got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies . 
A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report , although the resolution faces hard sledding later . 
The house passed finally , and sent to the Senate , a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities . 
The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees , passing the three on the calendar . 
One validated acts of school districts . 
Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District . 
The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District , for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted . 
Without dissent , senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district . 
Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site . 
Two tax revision bills were passed . 
One , by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba , would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized . 
Instead , retailers would sign a certificate of correctness , violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison , plus a $1,000 fine . 
It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League . 
The other bill , by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris , would relieve real estate brokers , who pay their own annual licensing fee , from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds . 
Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain , under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 , of El Paso , to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas . 
Marshall Formby of Plainview , former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission , suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress , eliminating the need for costly special elections . 
Under Formby's plan , an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , speaker of the House , attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court . 
Austin , Texas 
-- State representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay . 
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot , when Texas votes on a U.S. senator . 
Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole , sponsor of the poll idea , said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill . 
The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22 . 
The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval , by two-thirds majorities , before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot , Roberts said . 
Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice . 
All Dallas members voted with Roberts , except Rep. Bill Jones , who was absent . 
Austin , Texas 
-- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday . 
Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise , a Wise County hamlet of 250 people . 
When the shouting ended , the bill passed , 114 to 4 , sending it to the Senate , where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas . 
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse . 
The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project . 
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas . 
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds , and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill , did not sway Cotten's attack . 
The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas , Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission , Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs . 
`` This is a poor boy's bill '' , said Chapman . 
`` Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds . 
This would help the little peanut districts '' . 
Austin , Texas 
-- A Houston teacher , now serving in the Legislature , proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning `` educational methods '' . 
Rep. Henry C. Grover , who teaches history in the Houston public schools , would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called `` teaching methods '' courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate . 
A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours . 
Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching . 
The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects . 
`` A person with a master's degree in physics , chemistry , math or English , yet who has not taken Education courses , is not permitted to teach in the public schools '' , said Grover . 
College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses . 
Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal . 
Paris , Texas ( sp. ) 
-- The board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays , Kan. as the school's new president . 
Dr. Clark will succeed Dr. J. R. McLemore , who will retire at the close of the present school term . 
Dr. Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree from the University of Oklahoma . 
He also received a Master of Science degree from Texas A & I College and a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College , Weatherford , Okla. . 
In addition , Dr. Clark has studied at Rhode Island State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
During his college career , Dr. Clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman . 
Dr. Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools , as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville , Texas , High School , as an instructor at the University of Oklahoma , and as an associate professor of education at Fort Hays , Kan. , State College . 
He has served as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army . 
Denton , Texas ( sp. ) 
-- Principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of Supt. Chester O. Strickland . 
State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a `` blue ribbon '' citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program . 
The report , culminating a year long study of the ADC program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm , listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring ADC case load . 
The report called racial discrimination in employment `` one of the most serious causes of family breakdown , desertion , and ADC dependency '' . 
`` Must solve problem '' 
The monthly cost of ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars , said C. Virgil Martin , president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co. , committee chairman . 
`` We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon ADC for subsistence '' , Martin said . 
The volume of ADC cases will decrease , Martin reported , when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : Relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color . 
These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to ADC '' . 
Calls for extension 
Other recommendations made by the committee are : 
Extension of the ADC program to all children in need living with any relatives , including both parents , as a means of preserving family unity . 
Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy . 
Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest , Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday . 
The disclosure by Charles Bellows , chief defense counsel , startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial . 
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client , Alan Clements , 30 , a separate trial . 
Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom . 
Fears prejudicial aspects 
`` The statements may be highly prejudicial to my client '' , Bellows told the court . 
`` Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property . 
It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others '' . 
Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired , `` You mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this '' ? ? 
`` Yes , your honor '' , replied Bellows . 
`` What this amounts to , if true , is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case . 
There is a conflict among the defendants '' . 
Washington , July 24 
-- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio . 
The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone . 
Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port , Mass. , a White House spokesman said the address text still had `` quite a way to go '' toward completion . 
Decisions are made 
Asked to elaborate , Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary , replied , `` I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts '' . 
Salinger said the work President Kennedy , advisers , and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording , rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city . 
The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns , who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence `` by unfair and fundamentally illegal means '' . 
Karns said that the cases involved a matter `` of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence '' of the 50 persons . 
He said evidence was obtained `` in violation of the legal rights of citizens '' . 
Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases . 
In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been `` unable to make a case '' . 
Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler , special prosecutor . 
Issue jury subpoenas 
Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation , questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building , but did not take them before the grand jury . 
Mayer Goldberg , attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward , argued this procedure constituted intimidation . 
Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning . 
Karns said it was a `` wrongful act '' for Wexler to take statements `` privately and outside of the grand jury room '' . 
He said this constituted a `` very serious misuse '' of the Criminal court processes . 
`` Actually , the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county , altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court '' , said Karns , who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court . 
Faced seven cases 
Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons . 
Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with `` complementary '' miscount of the vote , in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another . 
The cases involved judges in the 33d , 24th , and 42d precincts of the 31st ward , the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward , the 18th precinct of the 4th ward , and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward . 
The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns . 
Two other cases also were under advisement . 
Claims precedent lacking 
After reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case , Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed , he would dismiss them . 
Washington , Feb. 9 
-- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs . 
The President , in a special message to Congress , tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships , build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools , and expand child health care and general medical research . 
The aged care plan , similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator , a fight on Capitol hill . 
It was defeated in Congress last year . 
Cost up to $37 a year 
It would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes . 
The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year . 
The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each . 
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system . 
The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1 , 1963 , if the plan is approved , because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs . 
Outlays would increase 
Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year , 1963 . 
Both figures would go higher in later years . 
Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years . 
These would be paid for out of general , not payroll , taxes . 
Nursing home care 
The aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 
Full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness , except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days . 
2 
Full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital . 
A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a `` unit formula '' allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit . 
3 
Hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient . 
4 
Community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness . 
The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged . 
Calls proposal modest 
He said his plan is designed to `` meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense , but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay '' . 
`` This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs '' , he said , `` and with sufficient ' deductible ' requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals . 
`` This is not a program of socialized medicine . 
It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed . 
Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital '' . 
Wouldn't pay doctors 
The plan does not cover doctor bills . 
They would still be paid by the patient . 
Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships , and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools . 
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care . 
Moreover , he said , many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs . 
Contributions to schools 
The scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students . 
The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships , based on need , of up to $2,000 a year per student . 
In addition , the government would pay a $1,000 `` cost of education '' grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants . 
Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 . 
The President recommended federal `` matching grants '' totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones . 
More for nursing homes 
In the area of `` community health services '' , the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction . 
He asked for another 10 million dollar `` initial '' appropriation for `` stimulatory grants '' to states to improve nursing homes . 
He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals . 
In the child health field , the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau . 
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute . 
Asks research funds 
The President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation . 
He did not say by how much . 
For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase , from 30 to 50 millions , in matching grants for building research facilities . 
The President said he will also propose increasing , by an unspecified amount , the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine . 
The President said his proposals combine the `` indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people , knowledge , services , facilities , and the means to pay for them '' . 
Reaction as expected 
Congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines . 
Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan . 
Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message . 
Senate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance . 
Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first . 
House Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D. , Tex. ) called the Kennedy program `` a mighty fine thing '' , but made no prediction on its fate in the House . 
Washington , Feb. 9 
-- Acting hastily under White House pressure , the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief . 
Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote . 
A number of scattered `` ayes '' and `` noes '' was heard . 
Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency . 
In the last eight years , all Presidential appointments , including those of cabinet rank , have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor . 
Enforce by demand 
The rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D. , Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961 . 
Oslo 
The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer , franker , and wider discussions , animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings . 
This has been a working session of an organization that , by its very nature , can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes . 
In Oslo , the ministers have met in a climate of candor , and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems . 
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the `` colonialist '' powers and those who have never , or not for a long time , had such problems . 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa , exacerbated by the difficulties , changes , and tragedies facing them , and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about , has been conspicuous by its absence . 
Explosion avoided 
In the case of Portugal , which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the NATO Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh , there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension . 
The general , remarkably courteous , explanation has left basic positions unchanged , but there has been no explosion in the council . 
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the UN General Assembly as to NATO members' votes , since a new ad hoc NATO committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance . 
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the NATO locomotive . 
Even Norway , despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance , is today closer to the NATO line . 
On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for . 
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as `` inconclusive '' . 
But he hastened to add that , if United States policies were not always clear , despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West , this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy . 
Exploratory mood 
A certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair , with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited . 
The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days , despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity , that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind , more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots . 
The Secretary of State himself , in his first speech , gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months . 
But where the core of NATO is concerned , the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance , `` cornerstone '' of its foreign policy , but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at NATO's disposal in European waters . 
The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin , an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole . 
Conflict surveyed 
The secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of NATO realization that East-West friction , wherever it take place around the globe , is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies , and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection . 
The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more , deeper , and more timely political consultation within the alliance , the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries , and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent . 
This increase in the `` threshold '' , as the conventional forces strengthening is called , will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come . 
Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down , but never completely fulfilled . 
Washington 
The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time . 
There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos . 
The United States , State Department officials explain , now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam . 
They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this . 
The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated . 
But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility . 
Policies modified 
The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos , rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference . 
This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make . 
It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration . 
Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas . 
But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : 
How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression ? ? 
Former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union . 
He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory . 
GOP restrained 
It does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it . 
They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans , if they had been in power , would have made `` amateurish and monumental blunders '' in Cuba . 
One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score . 
His reply , he said , was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now . 
But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first . 
The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky , chairman of the Republican National Committee , that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination . 
Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard , Boston University , Brandeis , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators . 
Detente urged 
This group pleads with the administration to `` give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups '' . 
It recommends that the United States `` seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; ; 
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds '' . 
Mr. Nixon , for his part , would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation . 
But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated . 
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos , almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected , generally , the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors . 
Aid plans revamped 
Very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels , a high official source disclosed , that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration . 
Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements . 
Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed . 
But thus far there has been no response in kind . 
Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations . 
In Laos , the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture . 
Again and again it asked the Communists to `` freeze '' the military situation in Laos . 
But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate . 
And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up , administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a `` great service '' and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization . 
SEATO was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos . 
But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos . 
( Some SEATO nations disagreed , however . 
) 
There was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally , unlike its more determined neighbors , Thailand and South Viet Nam . 
The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos . 
The pro-Western government , which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma `` neutralist '' government , never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army . 
There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt . 
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma , whom it felt was too trusting of Communists , it gradually had to relinquish them . 
One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . 
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by `` encouraging the removal '' of Prince Souvanna . 
Washington 
The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States . 
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the `` vitality of the nation '' . 
In an important assertion of national leadership in this field , he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime , to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems . 
The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend . 
Offenses multiply 
The President has also called upon the Attorney General , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts `` in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem . 
Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett , a special assistant to the Attorney General , as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime . 
His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948 , each year showing an increase in offenders . 
Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959 , about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age . 
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director , Raymond H. Hawksley , the present city CD head , believes . 
Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council `` or anyone else locally '' to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time . 
East Providence now has no civil defense program . 
Mr. Hawksley , the state's general treasurer , has been a part-time CD director in the city for the last nine years . 
He is not interested in being named a full-time director . 
Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program , Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director . 
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a CD director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs . 
Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time CD job . 
One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin , he said . 
Along with a director , the city should provide a CD headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized . 
Mr. Hawksley said . 
One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director , he said , is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program . 
Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios , sirens and rescue trucks , he said . 
Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks , similar to the CD vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station . 
He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area . 
Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city , Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack . 
The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point , he said , and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another . 
Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point . 
Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack . 
Such vital information , he said , has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know . 
If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time CD director , Mr. Hawksley said , then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally . 
One of the first things he would do , he said , would be to organize classes in first aid . 
Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government . 
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind . 
Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly . 
The governor's move into the so-called `` blue law '' controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant , deputy city clerk of Central Falls . 
A copy was released to the press . 
Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant . 
The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature . 
While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review , Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get `` the benefit of his views '' . 
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation , the governor said . 
`` I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings '' , Mr. Notte said , `` to obtain the views of the general public and religious , labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws '' . 
The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time `` with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales '' . 
The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws . 
Should there be evidence they are shirking , he has said , the state police will step into the situation . 
There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws . 
The statutes , similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times , severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath . 
The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday . 
The only day they `` have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday '' , the council's resolution said . 
The small shops `` must be retained , for they provide essential service to the community '' , according to the resolution , which added that they `` also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors '' . 
It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide `` great revenue '' to the local government . 
The council advised the governor that `` large supermarkets , factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business '' on Sunday . 
They `` operate on a volume basis '' , it was contended , `` and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community '' . 
Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- Democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties , George H. Reama , nationally known labor-management expert , said here yesterday . 
Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the `` welfare '' type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system . 
He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day . 
He said he was `` confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910 '' . 
That , he added , was when he was `` a very young man , a machinist and toolmaker by trade . 
`` That was before I studied law . 
Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party . 
The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track . 
He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track '' . 
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910 , the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources . 
He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory , most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties . 
Mr. Reama , who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said , `` Both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it '' . 
He said he favors wage increases for workers -- `` but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze '' -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices , he added . 
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy , Mr. Reama said : `` A Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own '' . 
Mr. Reama , far from really being retired , is engaged in industrial relations counseling . 
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town . 
William A. Martinelli , chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston , transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr. . 
The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post . 
Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days . 
He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work . 
A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier , town solicitor , over the exact manner in which the vote is handled . 
Mr. Martinelli has , in recent weeks , been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote , while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead . 
Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures . 
He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible . 
Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement . 
He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present , but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes . 
`` After inspiring this , I think we should certainly follow through on it '' , he declared . 
`` It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement '' . 
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission . 
`` Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement '' , he indicated , `` and to tell them what this will mean for the town '' . 
He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September . 
Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday , with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter . 
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks , it was indicated . 
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed `` false pretenses '' . 
Several signers affixed their names , it was learned , after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system . 
Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting . 
Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance . 
At the last session of the General Assembly , the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective . 
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation . 
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition . 
Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense . 
Plainfield 
-- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones R-Bergen , last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes , Democratic gubernatorial candidate , that the GOP is `` Campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism '' . 
Mitchell was for using it , Jones against , and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. R-Warren did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel . 
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club . 
It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs . 
Hughes said Monday , `` It is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism , but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired . 
Now he's gone , the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state '' . 
Sunday he had added , `` We can love Eisenhower the man , even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership '' . 
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign . 
`` How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this '' ? ? 
He asked . 
The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican `` and proud to have absorbed his philosophy '' while working in his adminstration . 
Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue . 
Regrets attack 
Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president . 
`` He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign '' , he said , `` because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign '' . 
The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark . 
Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary . 
He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign . 
State aid to schools , the continuance of railroad passenger service , the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority , and making New Jersey attractive to new industry . 
Decries joblessness 
Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate `` Must share the blame for this '' . 
Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant , he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform . 
`` But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time '' , Mitchell said . 
Jones , unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions , saved his barbs for Mitchell . 
He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises . 
`` He calls for help while saying he is against centralization , but you can't have it both ways '' , Jones said . 
The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities , real estate or motor vehicles , he said , `` and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue '' . 
Defends Ike 
Earlier , Mitchell said in a statement : 
`` I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes . 
His reference to ' discredited carcass ' or ' tattered remains ' of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history , to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States , and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations . 
`` I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste . 
`` Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature . 
It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit '' . 
Sees Jones ahead 
Sen. Charles W. Sandman , R-Cape May , said today Jones will run well ahead of his GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination . 
Sandman , state campaign chairman for Jones , was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel , Newark , of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones . 
Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years . 
Sandman said : `` The announcement that Sen. Clifford Case Aj , has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway . 
It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems . 
`` We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington . 
That failed . 
`` We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year . 
That , too , will fail '' . 
Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave. , Westfield , as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee . 
Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman . 
County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets , who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them . 
The proposal , Sheets said , represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a `` lip service word '' . 
Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines , enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge . 
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January , 1964 . 
Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful , he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines . 
The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange , for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County , was supported today by Edward W. Roos , West Orange public safety commissioner . 
Sheeran , a lawyer and former FBI man is running against the Republican organization's candidate , Freeholder William MacDonald , for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy , now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals . 
`` My experience as public safety commissioner '' , Roos said , `` has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience , and preferably one who is a lawyer . 
Jim Sheeran fits that description '' . 
Trenton 
-- William J. Seidel , state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development , has retired after 36 years of service . 
A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state . 
Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies . 
In October 1944 , he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section . 
Under his supervision , the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting . 
He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station . 
He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens . 
He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education . 
Boonton 
-- Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge `` to carry the issues to every corner of the state '' . 
He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : `` When I come back here after the November election you'll think , ' You're my man -- you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected ' '' . 
He said , `` We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just , and not what is expedient at the time '' . 
Attacks Republicans 
In his only attack on the Republicans , Hughes said , `` The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary . 
But we'll have a liberal , well planned , forward looking , honest platform . 
We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson . 
`` We'll take the truth to the people , and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November '' . 
He said , `` You can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration . 
But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead '' . 
He urged New Jersey to `` become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy '' . 
He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states , and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry . 
`` We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean '' , the former Superior Court judge said . 
`` To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s '' . 
Calling the Democrats the `` party that lives , breathes and thinks for the good of the people '' , Hughes asked , `` a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November '' . 
Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's `` Green Acres '' plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development . 
He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday . 
Conservation plan 
The plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state . 
The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis . 
Hughes said , `` This is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it '' , pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950 . 
He said `` Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas , there will be no land left to preserve '' . 
Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved . 
He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans . 
`` After the primary '' , he promised , `` I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong , dynamic administration . 
I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee '' . 
Trenton 
-- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues . 
The outgoing members , whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election , received carved wooden elephants , complete with ivory tusks , to remember the state committee by . 
There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18 , but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters . 
A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank , who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee . 
She also was the original GOP national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment . 
She served one four-year term on the national committee . 
Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates . 
At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable . 
Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years . 
The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders . 
Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party . 
Opposition reported 
Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary . 
These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city . 
Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor . 
In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate , Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley , the Bronx Democratic leader , and with Joseph T. Sharkey , the Brooklyn Democratic leader . 
Mayor visits Buckley 
As usual , he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio , the Manhattan leader . 
He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party . 
Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation . 
Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle . 
In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington , the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , who lives in the Bronx , from this year's ticket . 
But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor . 
Screvane and Beame hailed 
The Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane , who lives in Queens , to replace Abe Stark , the incumbent , as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame , who lives in Brooklyn , to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller . 
The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx . 
After his speech , reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions , published in yesterday's New York Times . 
The Mayor said : 
`` It didn't come from me . 
But as I have said before , if I announce my candidacy , I will have something definite to say about running mates '' . 
Boston , June 16 
-- A wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts . 
There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics . 
The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are `` all the same '' . 
`` It's ' See Joe , see Jim ' '' , he says . 
`` The hand is out '' . 
A political scientist writes of the growth of `` alienated voters '' , who `` believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt , selfish and beyond popular control . 
These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy , the object of which is to plunder them '' . 
Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'Connor's novel , `` The Last Hurrah '' . 
But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject . 
A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year . 
Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations . 
And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state . 
A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery , or worse , is the norm in Massachusetts public life . 
Day after day some new episode is reported . 
The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property . 
An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate . 
Washington , June 18 
-- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers . 
In the Senate , several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition . 
In the House , the Southern-Republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill , while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill . 
The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee . 
It is expected to be reported out Tuesday , but this is a little uncertain . 
The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble , Democrat of Arkansas , who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor . 
Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday . 
Leadership is hopeful 
The housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans . 
The Democratic leadership , however , hopes to pass it sometime this week . 
The $6,100,000,000 measure , which was passed last Monday by the Senate , provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families . 
It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories . 
The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee , where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy . 
They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts . 
Three groups to meet 
What could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958 . 
This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science , languages and mathematics . 
Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'Neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee . 
About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups , according to an official of the corps . 
In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval , $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies . 
Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage , Gordon Boyce , director of relations with the voluntary agencies , said in a Washington interview . 
Six of these were proposed by religious groups . 
They will be for teaching , agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia , Africa , the Middle East and Latin America . 
Question raised 
Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods , means and goals . 
There are a number of ways this could happen , the churchmen pointed out , and here is an example : 
Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled . 
When he protested , the hotel owner said : 
`` Why do you worry ? ? 
The U. S. Government is paying for it . 
The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers '' . 
Missionary explains 
`` I don't work for the Government '' , the American said . 
`` I'm a missionary '' . 
The hotel owner shrugged . 
`` Same thing '' , he said . 
And then , some churchmen remarked , there is a more classical church-state problem : 
Can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state ? ? 
R. Sargent Shriver Jr. , director of the corps , is certain that they can . 
No religious group , he declared in an interview , will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes . 
Moscow , June 18 
-- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia , Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said , beaming : `` Look , he took everything I had '' ! ! 
Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker . 
Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia , Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid . 
The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic , technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations . 
The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year , according to Western estimates . 
This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954 . 
In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries . 
United Nations , N. Y. , June 18 
-- A committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations . 
This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations . 
One effect of the proposal , which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength , as in the past , would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India . 
India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants . 
The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report . 
The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations . 
Formula is due this week 
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week . 
The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines : 
Each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts , such as political affairs officer , a department head or an economist , to start . 
Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts . 
Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point . 
Geneva , June 18 
-- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom . 
The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum , Premier of the pro-Western royal Government ; ; 
Prince Souvanna Phouma , leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc , and Prince Souphanouvong , head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces . 
The latter two are half-brothers . 
Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos . 
An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task , diplomats conceded . 
But no one was overly optimistic . 
Tactics studied in Geneva 
W. Averell Harriman of the United States , Malcolm MacDonald of Britain , Maurice Couve De Murville , France's Foreign Minister , and Howard C. Green , Canada's Minister of External Affairs , concluded , meanwhile , a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference . 
The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week . 
Princess Moune , Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter , read the Princes' statement . 
They had a two-hour luncheon together in `` an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation '' , she said . 
The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks , which are to last three days . 
The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days . 
To deal with principles 
The meetings in Zurich , the statement said , would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government . 
Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr. , 41 , as promotion manager of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims , president of the company . 
Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke , who resigned . 
The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January , 1946 , as a commercial artist in the advertising department . 
He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school , Fortier High school and Soule business college . 
From June , 1942 , until December , 1945 , Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps . 
While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville , Ill. . 
Before entering the service , Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans . 
He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter , Karol , 13 . 
They reside at 4911 Miles Dr. . 
Washington 
-- Thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20 . 
Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day , hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route . 
Pennsylvania Avenue , named for one of the original 13 states , perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint . 
But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it . 
Many buildings 
Within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings , plus shrines and monuments . 
Of course , 1600 Pennsylvania , the White House , is the most famous address of the free world . 
Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue , begins a series of great federal buildings , some a block long and all about seven-stories high . 
Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue , now about 169 years old . 
In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade . 
They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote . 
In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time . 
Seats on square 
Along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept . 
Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation . 
Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania , powered with lines that are underground . 
Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square , opposite the White House . 
In this historic square are several statues , but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson , hero of the Battle of New Orleans . 
Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units . 
About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade . 
Division one of the parade will be the service academies . 
Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas , the respective states of the President and of Vice-President L. B. Johnson . 
Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union . 
Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states ; ; 
division four will be headed by the Navy , followed by 11 states ; ; 
division five , by the Air Force followed by 11 states . 
Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard , followed by the reserve forces of all services , five states , Puerto Rico , the Virgin Islands , Guam , American Samoa , the trust territories and the Canal Zone . 
Jackson , Miss. 
-- What does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi ? ? 
Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time , no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future . 
This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross Barnett . 
Barnett , who came into office with no previous experience in public administration , has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well . 
Consequently , it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year . 
Could be scramble 
Some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far . 
The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office . 
There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session , it will really throw his administration into a scramble . 
Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful `` honeymoon '' he had in the 1960 legislative session . 
If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961 , it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session . 
The odds favor a special session , more than likely early in the year . 
Districts issue 
Legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating . 
Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure . 
The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat . 
With eyes focused on the third congressional district , the historic Delta district , and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go , the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature . 
Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 , with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House . 
Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents , the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck . 
And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together . 
Future clouded 
Barnett , as the titular head of the Democratic party , apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary . 
With a Democratic administration , party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election . 
Now , the picture is clouded , and even US Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis , who remained loyal to the ticket , are uncertain of their status . 
Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen . 
Baton Rouge , La. 
-- The Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961 , with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses . 
The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue . 
But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government . 
The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress , in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent . 
The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy , since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program . 
But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation . 
Legislators weary 
Indeed , the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat . 
The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program . 
The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote . 
The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes . 
Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy . 
If it fails to pass , he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration . 
He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature . 
Actually , Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway . 
Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration . 
This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly . 
They would like to convey the notion something is being done , even though it is something they know to be ineffectual . 
Underlying concern 
Passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition . 
He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle . 
Then he could tell them to go home , while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period . 
It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million , since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one . 
But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program , a not unlikely conclusion , it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes . 
This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash . 
It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year . 
If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill , or any other tax bill , it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma . 
Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session , the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues . 
Constant problem 
In either case , it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser . 
The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor . 
It is one that most try to avoid , as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem . 
But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off , it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature . 
This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature , so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year . 
A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize . 
Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves . 
The new year might see some house-cleaning , either genuine or token , depending upon developments , to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms . 
City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had `` an inside track '' with the city . 
Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000 . 
Shortcuts unnoticed 
Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the `` legitimate '' bids of competing contractors . 
The Hughes concern then took `` shortcuts '' on the project but got paid anyway , Hemphill said . 
The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : 
The city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract . 
The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project . 
The signature of Harold V. Varani , former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property , appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project . 
Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor . 
Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter . 
The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959 . 
Concern bankrupt 
The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries , Inc. , both of 3646 N. 2d St. , filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law . 
On Monday , the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization . 
Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish , Jr. . 
Intervenes in case 
The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms . 
Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co. . 
At Berger's direction , the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there . 
`` I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated '' , Berger said . 
The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track . 
The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints . 
The city paid for work on 75 , of which no more than 21 were repaired , Hemphill charged . 
Wide range in bids 
Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint . 
The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge , Mass. , which listed the same officers as Hughes , was $600 per joint . 
But , Hemphill added , bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint . 
Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference . 
Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes company . 
`` We won't know the full amount until we get a full report '' , Wagner said . 
`` We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond '' , Berger said . 
Wagner replied , `` Can't you just see the headline : ' City Hooked for $172,000 ' '' ? ? 
' know enough to sue ' 
Berger insisted that `` we know enough to sue for the full amount '' . 
Douglas M. Pratt , president of the PTC , who attended the meeting , said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El . 
`` We want to find out who knew about it '' , Pratt said . 
`` Certain people must have known about it '' . 
`` The PTC is investigating the whole matter '' , Pratt said . 
Samuel D. Goodis , representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association , objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees , saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year . 
Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee . 
For hotels with 1000 rooms , the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year , Goodis said . 
Testifies at hearing 
His testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses , permits and city services . 
The new fees are expected to raise an additional $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year after that . 
The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses , hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room . 
The cost of a license now is $2 , with an annual renewal fee of $1 . 
Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels . 
Revenue estimated 
The city expects the higher rooming house , hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000 a year . 
The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan , spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia , on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses . 
A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer , who formerly raised pedigreed dogs . 
The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog . 
Commissioner replies 
Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care . 
In reply , Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees . 
He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 to the Women's S.P.C.A. ; ; 
$15,000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites . 
Backs higher fees 
City Finance Director Richard J. McConnell indorsed the higher fees , which , he said , had been under study for more than a year . 
The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees , he said . 
The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis . 
Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday , it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A. Davenport , counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard's hit-run car . 
The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower , Davenport said . 
Barnard , who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges , was fined $500 by Judge Warren K. Hess , and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time . 
He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning . 
Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery , 39 . 
His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation . 
The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project . 
The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project . 
One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865 . 
The tract is bounded by Island Ave. , Dicks Ave. , 61st St. , and Eastwick Ave. . 
Four parks planned 
It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses , garden apartments , four small parks , schools , churches , a shopping center and several small clusters of stores . 
The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm , a Philadelphia builder , for work in the project . 
The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp. , a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders , which is interested in developing part of the project . 
Would bar vehicles 
The plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis , former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp. . 
The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic . 
It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project . 
The esplanade eliminates Grovers Ave. , which on original plans ran through the center of the development .

-- The president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work . 
Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden , 42 , the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union , suffered multiple fractures of both ankles . 
He was in Baptist Memorial hospital . 
Ignition sets off blast 
The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work . 
`` I'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway '' , he said . 
Gladden's wife and two of his sons , John , 17 , and Jim , 13 , were inside the house . 
The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall . 
Hood flies over house 
The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house . 
The left front wheel landed 100 feet away . 
Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device , containing either TNT or nitroglycerine , was apparently placed under the left front wheel . 
It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter . 
Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night . 
The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union . 
Led fight on teamsters 
Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters , which began organizing city firemen in 1959 . 
The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing . 
A $500 reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas City , Kas. . 
The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and Eugene Shiflett . 
Mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee . 
Both have been active in the association . 
Ankara , Turkey , Oct. 24 ( AP ) 
-- Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president . 
An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat . 
By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago , the army general staff , led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay , had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government . 
The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president . 
Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months . 
The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned . 
Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own . 
Vincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney , it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond , District Attorney . 
Ierulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31 . 
Ierulli , 29 , has been practicing in Portland since November , 1959 . 
He is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law . 
He is married and the father of three children . 
Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically , E. M. Martin , assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night . 
Martin , who has been in office in Washington , D. C. , for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel . 
He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways , following their own paths . 
`` We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which , if not identical , is congenial with ours '' , he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty . 
Patience needed 
Insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice , he said , was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union . 
He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in , and added , `` so long as people rebel , we must not give up '' . 
Martin called for patience on the part of Americans . 
`` The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build '' , he said . 
By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare , he said . 
Individual help best 
`` We have no reason to fear failure , but we must be extraordinarily patient '' , the assistant secretary said . 
Economically , Martin said , the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves . 
Private business is more effective than government aid , he explained , because individuals are able to work with the people themselves . 
The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country , at what he termed a `` social cost '' . 
Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country . 
The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack . 
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go , and whose advice it should follow . 
The board members , after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar , 1409 SW Maplecrest Dr. , said they thought they had already been cooperating . 
Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem , in case of atomic attack , but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go . 
Dr. Melvin W. Barnes , superintendent , said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership , perhaps on the national level , to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would `` be more fruitful '' , and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district . 
`` Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster '' , he said . 
`` Nobody really expects to evacuate . 
I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following . 
Mrs. Molvar , who kept reiterating her request that they `` please take a stand '' , said , `` We must have faith in somebody -- on the local level , and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children '' . 
Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans , even for a high school where there were lots of cars `` might not be realistic and would not work '' . 
Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program . 
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting . 
It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done , is going to be done and what it thought should be done . 
Salem ( AP )

Beaverton School District No. 48 board members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a Monday night workshop session . 
A bond issue which would have provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools was defeated by district voters in January . 
Last week the board , by a 4 to 3 vote , decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 ( junior high school ) system or the 8-4 system . 
Board members indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken on Nov. 15 , the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary schools .

A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God , in session at the Memorial Coliseum . 
The council revised , in an effort to strengthen , the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966 . 
The changes , unanimously adopted , were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible . 
The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible . 
At the adoption , the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman , general superintendent , commented , `` The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has , without compromise , stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives '' . 
New point added 
Many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; ; 
however , the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list . 
The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination , now reads : 
`` The scriptures , both Old and New Testament , are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man , the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct '' . 
The third belief , in six points , emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ , and : 
-- emphasizes the Virgin birth 
-- the sinless life of Christ 
-- His miracles 
-- His substitutionary work on the cross 
-- His bodily resurrection from the dead 
-- and His exaltation to the right hand of God . 
Super again elected 
Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God . 
His offices are in Springfield , Mo. . 
Election came on the nominating ballot . 
Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program , `` Breakthrough '' scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years . 
In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman , urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program , with `` Breakthrough '' the theme for the first two years . 
The Rev. R. L. Brandt , national secretary of the home missions department , stressed the need for the first two years' work . 
`` Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church . 
This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life '' , he told delegates Friday . 
Church loses pace 
Talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes , he said `` our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge '' . 
`` In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches '' , the Rev. Mr. Brandt said , adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons . 
`` In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois , where we have 200 ; ; 
800 in Southern New England , we have 60 ; ; 
we need 100 in Rhode Island , we have none '' , he said . 
To step up the denomination's program , the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years . 
To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods , he said . 
' church meets change ' 
`` The church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour '' . 
A capsule view of proposed plans includes : 
-- Encouraging by every means , all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches . 
-- Engaging mature , experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers . 
-- Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen , who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ) . 
-- Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches . 
U.S. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial . 
Denials were of motions of dismissal , continuance , mistrial , separate trial , acquittal , striking of testimony and directed verdict . 
In denying motions for dismissal , Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that `` a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are '' . 
Attorney Dwight L. Schwab , in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein , argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy , but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide . 
Proof lack charged 
Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.S. mails to defraud , to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied : 
`` It is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.S. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy , and the mails were then used to carry it out '' . 
In the afternoon , defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements , some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case . 
Miami , Fla. , March 17 
-- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision , this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3 . 
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage . 
Siebern hits homer 
Over the first five frames , Jack Fisher , the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant , held the A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits . 
Then Dick Hyde , submarine-ball hurler , entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock . 
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game , and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts . 
House throws wild 
With one down in the eighth , Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle . 
Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt . 
Then Heywood Sullivan , Kansas City catcher , singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run . 
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser , a wild pitch , and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center . 
The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion , gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers . 
Three were doubles , Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one . 
Hartman impressive 
Bill Kunkel , Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium . 
The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth . 
Hartman , purchased by the A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall , allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance , and merited the triumph . 
Keegan , a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder , gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames , escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally . 
Robinson doubles again 
In the ninth , Robinson led off with his second double of the night , a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left . 
Whitey Herzog , performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring , worked Keegan for a base on balls . 
Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce . 
Pete Ward was sent in for House and , after failing in a bunt attempt , popped to Howser on the grass back of short . 
John Powell , batting for Adair , fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches , and Buddy Barker , up for Stepanovich , bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest . 
The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding , along with Robinson , the two Birds who got a pair of hits , doubled to right center , moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate . 
The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out . 
Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally . 
Lumpe errs 
Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single , and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error . 
Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners . 
When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple , he was cut down in a close play at third , Tuttle to Andy Carey . 
The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : 
Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center . 
Carey Singles 
Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first . 
It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit . 
Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play . 
Breeding to Adair to Gentile , setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center . 
If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days , it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees , who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon . 
Miami , Fla. , March 17 
-- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training . 
Hansen , who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a 
freshman average , completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players . 
The big , 22-year-old shortstop , the 1960 American league `` rookie-of-the-year '' , flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore , signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row . 
15 pounds lighter 
The 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds , 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring . 
He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence . 
When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox , Ky. , Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 -- `` too light for me to be at my best '' he said . 
`` I feel good physically '' , Hansen added , `` but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now '' . 
Seeks `` improved fielding '' 
The rangy , Albany ( Cal. ) native , a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz , set `` improved fielding '' as his 1961 goal . 
`` I think I can do a better job with the glove , now that I know the hitters around the league a little better '' , he said . 
Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New York Yankees . 
Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm , the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists , are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.M. contest . 
Duren , Sheldon on hill 
Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon , a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn ( N.Y. ) farm club of the Class-D New York-Pennsylvania League , are the probable rival pitchers . 
Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker , 22 , are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P.M. encounter . 
Ralph Houk , successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm , plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St. Petersburg , including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games . 
The famed Yankee Clipper , now retired , has been assisting as a batting coach . 
Squad cut near 
Pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course , also at Fort Knox , Ky. . 
The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen . 
Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit . 
`` Take a ride on this one '' , Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat , headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight . 
It was the first of two doubles by Robinson , who was in a mood to celebrate . 
Just before game time , Robinson's pretty wife , Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer . 
Unfortunately , Brooks's teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers . 
Hansen arrived just before nightfall , two hours late , in company with Lee MacPhail ; ; 
J. A. W. Iglehart , chairman of the Oriole board of directors , and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn . 
Their flight was delayed , Dunn said , when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane . 
Ex-Oriole Clint Courtney , now catching for the A's is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast . 
`` But they shouldda brought in Tokyo , too '' , added Old Scrapiron . 
`` Then we'd really have someplace to go '' . 
Bowie , Md. , March 17 
-- Gaining her second straight victory , Norman B. , Small , Jr.'s Garden Fresh , a 3-year-old filly , downed promising colts in the $4,500 St. Patrick's Day Purse , featured seventh race here today , and paid $7.20 straight . 
Toying with her field in the early stages , Garden Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs . 
8,280 attend races 
Richard M. Forbes's Paget , which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages , tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in front of Glen T. Hallowell's Milties Miss . 
A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 St. Patty Day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program . 
Prior to the featured race , the stewards announced that apprentice James P. Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday . 
Culmone gets first win 
Garden Fresh , the result of a mating of Better Self and Rosy Fingered , seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St. Patrick's Day Purse with some speed in reserve . 
She was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 claiming event . 
Cleveland , March 17 ( AP ) 
-- George Kerr , the swift-striding Jamaican , set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight , beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1 . 
Kerr , who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3 , wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards . 
Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield . 
Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race . 
Then Kerr , a graduate student from Illinois , moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn . 
Mills was timed in 1.10.4 . 
The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games , final indoor meet of the season , got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run . 
Mrs. Grace Butcher , of nearby Chardon , a 27-year-old housewife who has two children , finished in 2.21.6 . 
She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen Shipley , of Wellsley College , in the National A.A.U. meet in Columbus , Ohio . 
San Francisco , March 17 ( AP ) 
-- Bobby Waters of Sylvania , Ga. , relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League , will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin Hospital here . 
Waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season . 
While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician . 
St. Petersburg , Fla. , March 17 ( AP ) 
-- Two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today . 
Austin , Texas 
-- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays , Eldon Moritz , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games . 
Time stands still every time Moritz , a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran , goes into the field . 
Although he never gets to play while the clock is running , he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday , in fact -- out of football . 
Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl . 
That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries . 
He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State . 
Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback , the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team . 
But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response , `` place-kicker '' . 
A 208-pound , 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford , Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking . 
Last year , when he worked out at halfback all season , he didn't get into a single game . 
`` This year , coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me '' , said Moritz . 
`` So I started practicing on it in spring training . 
Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and , as a result , several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough . 
Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and , as a result , he hopes to start practicing field goals this week . 
He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School , including one that beat Anson , 3-0 , in a 1953 district game . 
`` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school '' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time . 
I never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years '' . 
Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury . 
He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee , then played 77 minutes in 1956 . 
His statistical record that year , when Texas won only one game and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards , punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards . 
He went into the Army in March , 1957 , and returned two years later . 
But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season . 
Place kicking is largely a matter of timing , Moritz declared . 
`` Once you get the feel of it , there's not much to it . 
I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel . 
Practice helps you to get your timing down . 
`` It's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often , your timing gets off '' . 
Moritz , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session . 
`` If you kick too much , your leg gets kinda dead '' , he explained . 
Footnotes : 
In their first three games , the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times , or 40 per cent ; ; 
their total passing yardage in three games , 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts , is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries . 
Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season , when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; ; 
he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games . 
Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game , for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards , gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench . 
Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma . 
Last week , when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing , he said : `` That won't last long '' . 
It didn't ; ; 
Monday , he had four Longhorns in the top four . 
A good feeling prevailed on the SMU coaching staff Monday , but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University . 
The Mustangs don't play this week . 
`` We're just real happy for the players '' , Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy . 
`` I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on . 
It was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ) '' . 
Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as `` a good feeling , I think , on the part of the coaches and the players . 
We needed it and we got it '' . 
Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon . 
Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game . 
`` Nelson played magnificent football '' , Meek praised . 
`` He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times . 
And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown . 
He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football '' . 
Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages . 
One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory . 
`` As soon as it started to form , Gannon spotted it '' , Meek said . 
`` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around . 
He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss '' . 
The Air Force's , and the game's , final play , was a long pass by quarterback Bob McNaughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards . 
`` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek said . 
`` He almost brought it back all the way '' . 
Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice , Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice . 
`` Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game '' , Meek said . 
`` He'll be out of action all this week . 
He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game . 
There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee '' . 
Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland . 
`` He's looking a lot better , and he's able to run '' , Meek explained . 
`` We'll let him do a lot of running this week , but I don't know if he'll be able to play '' . 
The game players saw the Air Force film Monday , ran for 30 minutes , then went in , while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes . 
`` We'll work hard Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday '' , Meek said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday . 
We'll work out about an hour on Saturday , then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week , then taper off '' . 
SMU will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday , Oct. 21 . 
Huddle hearsay 
-- Held out of Texas Tech's sweat-suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford , who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders' 38-7 loss to Texas A & M Because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday , Baylor worked out in the rain Monday -- mud or no mud . 
End Gene Raesz , who broke a hand in the Owl's game with LSU , was back working out with Rice Monday , and John Nichols , sophomore guard , moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury . 
The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday -- a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night , but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett , shaken up in the Tech game , would not play against Trinity Saturday . 
Halfback Bud Priddy , slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle , joined TCU's workout Monday . 
The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos -- but their visit will be a short one . 
The Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings . 
Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey , who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks , apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-National Football Leaguers , M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb . 
Rabb , the former Louisiana State field general , came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers , defending league champions . 
`` Just our luck '' ! ! 
Exclaimed Stram . 
`` Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way '' . 
Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver , and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star , Jack Spikes , though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury . 
`` Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well '' , said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game . 
`` In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job '' . 
The Texans won the game through ball control , with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes . 
`` We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack '' , explained Stram . 
`` They can be going along , doing little damage , then bang , bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble '' . 
The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans , but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off . 
The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes , the flashy halfback . 
He was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards . 
The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson , the speedy halfback , hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas . 
A quick touchdown resulted . 
`` That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away '' , said Stram , quipping , `` I think I'll put that play in the book '' . 
The early Southwest Conference football leaders -- Texas , Arkansas and Texas A & M -- made a big dent in the statistics last week . 
Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards ( 1,065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new SWC high . 
Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip TCU , and A & M , with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950 . 
Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards , the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards . 
Texas leads in per-game rushing averages , 355 yards , and passing 149 ( to Baylor's 126 ) , but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189 ) . 
A & M has the best defense against passes , 34.7 yards per game . 
Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use , the major leagues have ordered their own tests , which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis , 5-3 . 
The husky 6-3 , 205-pound lefthander , was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area . 
It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight . 
They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack . 
Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning . 
He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings , an unusual characteristic for a southpaw . 
The Bears took the lead in the first inning , as they did in Sunday's opener , and never lagged . 
Dick McAuliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack . 
After Al Paschal gruonded out , Jay Cooke walked and Jim McDaniel singled home McAuliffe . 
Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left . 
Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout . 
The Bears added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner , Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer's glove . 
Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth . 
Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner , Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infield roller accounted for the tallies . 
The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert . 
Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth . 
Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48 , thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play . 
Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base . 
Bingles and bobbles : 
Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits . 
It was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order . 
The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark . 
Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ . 
Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer , Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage . 
Lefty Wyman Carey , another Denver rookie , will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night . 
Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn . 
Dallas , Tex. , May 1 -- ( AP ) 
-- Kenny Lane of Muskegon , Mich. , world's seventh ranked lightweight , had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler , Tex. , here Monday night . 
St. Paul-Minneapolis , May 1 -- ( AP ) 
-- Billy Gardner's line double , which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field , drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday . 
Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game , a liner to center . 
He came all the way around on Gardner's hit before 5777 fans . 
It was Gardner's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year . 
Turk Lown was tagged with the loss , his second against no victories , while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss . 
The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left . 
The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly . 
Jim Landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead , but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard . 
Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front . 
A double by Green , Allison's run-scoring 2-baser , an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth . 
Ogden , Utah , May 1 -- ( AP ) 
-- Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball . 
`` I've had it '' , he told a newsman . 
`` I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club '' . 
This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout . 
Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a batting average in the first 12 games . 
He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday , without an official word to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno , Nev. , where his wife , former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen , awaited . 
She said , when she learned Jackie was heading home : `` I'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances '' . 
The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden , Utah , for a few minutes . 
Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him . 
The conductor said to Ritchie : `` I don't think you want to talk to him . 
You'll probably get a ball bat on the head . 
He's mad at the world '' . 
But Jackie had gone into the station . 
Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand . 
`` I told him who I was and he was quite cold . 
But he warmed up after a while . 
I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole . 
He said he had never talked to Liston '' . 
Liston is Bill Liston , baseball writer for the Boston Traveler , who quoted Jensen as saying : 
`` I can't hit anymore . 
I can't run . 
I can't throw . 
Suddenly my reflexes are gone . 
Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging . 
And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday . 
Both , of course , were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime . 
Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts . 
It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone . 
And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked , `` Wish I was 40 , and a top-grade big leaguer . 
The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days . 
But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history . 
Yes , with Bob Grove , Carl Hubbell , Herb Pennock , Art Nehf , Vernon Gomez , et al . 
Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow , a ball player's ball player , as they say in the trade . 
I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792 . 
`` Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions '' , remarked Enos Slaughter , another all-out guy , who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse . 
The spectacular Mays , who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25 , joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings . 
Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience . 
Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field . 
Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies , the Braves' Joe Adcock , Lou Gehrig of the Yankees , Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito , then with Cleveland , made their history on the road . 
Willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle . 
This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion , depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-Yankee . 
The record books , however , would favor the Giants' ace . 
In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases . 
Once the figure was 30-30 . 
Willie's lifetime batting average of is 11 points beyond Mickey's . 
The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park . 
It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump . 
The Denver-area TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs , thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home . 
This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers . 
The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the `` Living Room Athletic Club '' when games were cut off . 
Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy . 
This year , I am told , the CBS network will continue to abide by the rule but NBC will play to a conclusion here . 
There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise . 
It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good , especially at the minor league level . 
You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy . 
This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game . 
Cincinnati , Ohio ( AP ) 
-- The powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati , crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale . 
With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries , the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers , the most ever used by one team in a series game . 
Johnny Blanchard , Mantle's replacement , slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning . 
Hector Lopez , subbing for Berra , smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth . 
The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors . 
The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud . 
In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center , about 400 feet away , with two men on . 
Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game , trailing only 6-3 , but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out . 
In the fifth , Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley , but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter . 
The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager . 
Only Bucky Harris , the `` boy-manager '' of Washington in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat . 
Philadelphia , Jan. 23 
-- Nick Skorich , the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles , was elevated today to head coach . 
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year . 
He succeeds Buck Shaw , who retired at the end of last season . 
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer . 
Williams is a defensive coach . 
Gauer works with the ends . 
Choice was expected 
The selection had been expected . 
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings , the newest National Football League entry . 
Van Brocklin , the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title , was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday . 
Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player . 
With Skorich at the helm , the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running , rather than passing . 
In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials . 
Skorich , however , is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing . 
Coach played 3 years 
Skorich , who is 39 years old , played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers . 
An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season . 
He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949 . 
He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy , N. Y. . 
He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach . 
Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers . 
The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959 . 
Skorich began his new job auspiciously today . 
At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth , the Eagles were honored for winning the championship . 
Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players , coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football . 
With the announcement of a `` special achievement award '' to William A. ( ( Bill ) Shea , the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter , Baseball Writers' Association of America , at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . 
Shea , the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee , will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn , the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; ; 
Frank Graham , the Journal-American sports columnist ; ; 
Bill Mazeroski , the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates , and Casey Stengel , the former manager of the Yankees . 
Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award . 
Mazeroski , whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game , will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series . 
Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award . 
To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year . 
Show follows ceremonies 
A crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies , which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit , dance and song . 
The 53-year-old Shea , a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background , is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York . 
Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley , Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume , Shea worked relentlessly . 
His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city . 
The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees . 
Despite countless barriers and disappointments , Shea moved forward . 
When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion , he sought to convince another National League club to move here . 
When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league , the Continental , with New York as the key franchise . 
The Continental League never got off the ground , but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand . 
Flushing stadium in works 
The New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson . 
A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works , and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick . 
Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium . 
Shea and his wife , Nori , make their home at Sands Point , L. I. . 
Bill Jr. , 20 , Kathy , 15 , and Patricia , 9 , round out the Shea family . 
Shea was born in Manhattan . 
He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington . 
He played basketball there while working toward a law degree . 
Later , Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians , a minor league professional football team . 
He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League . 
All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday . 
On Friday , Roger Maris , the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award , will meet with Roy Hamey , the general manager . 
Maris is in line for a big raise . 
Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight . 
The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre . 
Palmer , golf's leading money-winner in 1960 , and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin . 
Deane Beman , the National Amateur champion , and all the metropolitan district champions , including Bob Gardner , the amateur title-holder , also will receive awards . 
The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John McAuliffe of Plainfield , N. J. , and Palm Beach , Fla. , for his sponsorship of charity tournaments . 
Horton Smith of Detroit , a former president of the Professional Golfers Association , will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness . 
The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington , Democrat of Missouri . 
Golf's golden boy 
Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months . 
He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money . 
He was heralded as `` Sportsman of the Year '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt . 
But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot . 
A couple of weeks ago , he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole . 
It made him human . 
And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair . 
If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege , there was hope left for all . 
It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold . 
He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all . 
The world's best golfer , shooting below par , came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher . 
He boomed a 280-yard drive . 
Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance . 
No margin for error 
On the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole , Arnold whipped into his second shot . 
The ball went off in a majestic arc , an out-of-bounds slice . 
He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds . 
He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side . 
`` It is possible that I over-corrected '' , he said ruefully . 
Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes . 
So he wound up with a dozen . 
`` It was a nice round figure , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse , not too much perturbed . 
From the standpoint of the army of duffers , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open . 
The idol of the hackers , of course , is Ray Ainsley , who achieved a 19 in the United States Open . 
Their secondary hero is another pro , Willie Chisholm , who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully . 
Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes , who tried to keep count . 
Stickler for rules 
`` How many is that , Jim '' ? ? 
Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project . 
`` Thirteen '' , said Long Jim . 
`` Nae , man '' , said Willie , `` ye must be countin' the echoes '' . 
He had a 16 . 
Palmer's dozen were honestly earned . 
Nor were there any rules to save him . 
If there had been , he would have found a loophole , because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book . 
This knowledge has come in handy , too . 
His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway . 
The ball floated downstream . 
A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy , who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie . 
Arnold sent for Joe Dey , the executive secretary of the golf association . 
Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream . 
`` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold with a grin , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' . 
For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity , Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings . 
Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors . 
He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right . 
That's how he first won the Masters in 1958 . 
It happened on the twelfth hole , a 155-yarder . 
Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green , an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains , thereby bringing local rules into force . 
Ruling from on high 
`` I can remove the ball , can't I '' ? ? 
Asked Palmer of an official . 
`` No '' , said the official . 
`` You must play it where it lies '' . 
`` You're wrong '' , said Arnold , a man who knows the rules . 
`` I'll do as you say , but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling '' . 
He scored a 4 for the embedded ball , a 3 with the provisional one . 
The golfing fathers ruled in his favor . 
So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke . 
Until a few weeks ago , however , Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers . 
But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys , a bigger hero than he ever had been before . 
A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today . 
Other items on the agenda during the meetings , which are expected to continue through Saturday , concern television , rules changes , professional football's hall of fame , players' benefits and constitutional amendments . 
The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division , plus two games against teams in the other division . 
However , this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks . 
Pete Rozelle , the league commissioner , pointed out : 
`` We'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other '' . 
Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates . 
If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies , they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season . 
`` Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat '' , Mauch said here the other day . 
`` The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year . 
They have the same men , no age problem , no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season , along with Bobby Shantz '' . 
Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals , who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960 , breaking even with them , will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions . 
The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9 . 
Change in pitchers . 
Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher , from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio , for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; ; 
2 The desire to give Broglio as many starts as possible ; ; 
3 The Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday . 
Manager Hemus , eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand , moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment . 
After Thursday's open date , Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night . 
Harvey Haddix , set back by the flu this season , will start against his former Cardinal mates , who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium . 
Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck . 
Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds , despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960 . 
Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game . 
Mizell has won both of his starts . 
Nieman kept in lineup . 
After a lengthy workout yesterday , an open date , Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup . 
That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants . 
`` I have to stay with Nieman for a while '' , Hemus said . 
`` Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready . 
With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh , I may use Don Taussig in center '' . 
`` Lindy McDaniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes , and he looked good '' , Hemus said . 
`` He should be getting back in the groove before long . 
Our pitching is much better than it has shown '' . 
The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice , but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday . 
Six Bucks over . 
Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend , the champions had eight men hitting over . 
Despite the recession , Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess , Gino Cimoli , Bill Virdon , Bob Clemente and Dick Groat , each 
, Dick Stuart , Don Hoak 
and Bob Skinner 
. 
Bill Mazeroski with and Hal Smith with were the only Pirates dragging their feet . 
Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend , who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs . 
Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week . 
`` We're getting Friend some runs for a change , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh said . 
`` Virdon has been blasting the ball . 
No plunkers for him '' . 
Six Bucs over . 
The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year , when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season . 
On last May 1 , the Cardinals stood at 7-6 , ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone . 
In 1958 , the Birds were 3-10 on May 1 . 
A year later they were 4-13 . 
Since 1949 , the St. Louis club has been below on May 1 just four times . 
The '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning , then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories . 
The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs , the club's top since 1949 . 
Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories . 
Since 1949 , the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team . 
Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8 . 
The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants , who dropped 11 of their first 13 . 
They honored the battling Billikens last night . 
Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who , in the words of Coach John Benington , `` had more confidence in themselves than I did '' . 
The most valuable player award was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski , Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer . 
In addition , a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann , the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury . 
`` You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing '' , Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies , `` but what this team had was a little different . 
The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability . 
They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do . 
`` Several times I found the players pepping me up , where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk . 
We'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say , ' Don't worry , Coach -- we'll get 'em all right ' '' . 
The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg , sports editor of the Post-Dispatch . 
Kieffer , the only junior in the group , was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch , as well as his all-round excellent play . 
Mankowski , the ball-hawking defensive expert , was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.'s nationally televised victory . 
Benington said , `` I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day '' . 
Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills . 
After the coach listed all the boy's faults , Hartweger said , `` Coach before I leave here , you'll get to like me '' . 
Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team . 
As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl , he said , `` I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play '' . 
Bob Burnes , sports editor of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann with his award . 
Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time . 
Within a week after the injury , suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament , Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington . 
On the clock given him was the inscription , `` For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball , 1960-61 '' . 
Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric , Donnell Reid , Bill Nordmann , Dave Harris , Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich . 
`` This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future '' , Benington pointed out . 
`` By winning against Bradley , Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts , they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it '' . 
St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game . 
Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game , said to be the first in Billiken baseball history , as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College , 5-1 , at Crystal City . 
The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie . 
The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday . 
Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double , Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple . 
St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field . 
The game opened a busy week for Washington . 
The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy , Ill. , Saturday . 
Happy hitting 
If it's true that contented cows give more milk , why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits ? ? 
The two top talents of the time , Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays , have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations . 
And that's meant as a boost , not a knock . 
Mays and Mantle , both 10-year men at 30 , have so much ability that , baseball men agree , they've never hit the heights . 
Their heights , that is . 
Mantle , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter , had one sensational triple-crown season , 1959 , when he batted and also led the American League in home runs , 52 , and rbi's , 130 . 
Like the Yankees' slugger , Mays , the terror of the Giants , has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players , but not by -- or for -- Willie . 
His best years were 1954 when he hit with 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases . 
Now , apparently happier under new managers , Mays and Mantle , the perfect players , are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks . 
Labor relations 
Yes , we know , they're professionals , men paid to play , and they shouldn't care how they're handled , just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month . 
The truth is , though , that men react differently to different treatment . 
For that matter , Stan Musial is rare , possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers , reserving his opinions , but not his effort . 
Mantle , it's apparent , resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility . 
The old man was almost too possessive . 
Stengel inherited DiMaggio , Rizzuto , but he brought up Mantle from Class C to the majors , from Joplin to New York . 
With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him , Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter , but also the best bunter , base-runner and outfielder . 
Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats . 
Inheriting a more mature Mantle , who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway , Ralph Houk quietly bestowed , no pun intended , the mantle of authority on Mickey . 
The Major decided that , rather than be led , the slugger could lead . 
And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far . 
The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule , pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr. , Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books , Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927 . 
Four for Alvin 
Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year . 
Willie's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark . 
Next to Leo Durocher , Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month , to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant . 
Romantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F. Lee H. Wendell , who are to be married at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow in the Lake Forest home of her brother , J. Hampton Monroe , and Mrs. Monroe . 
Only the families and a dozen close friends will be present . 
The bride's brother , Walter D. Monroe Jr. , will give her in marriage . 
In the small group will be the junior and senior Mrs. Walter Monroe ; ; 
the bridegroom's parents , the Barrett Wendells , who are returning from a winter holiday in Sarasota , Fla. , for the occasion ; ; 
and his brother , Mr. Wendell Jr. , and his wife , who will arrive from Boston . 
Mr. Wendell Jr. will be best man . 
Also present will be the bride's children , Joan , 13 , and Kirkland , 11 .

Their mother is Mrs. Camilla Alsop Wendell . 
Mr. Wendell and his bride will live in his Lake Forest house . 
They will take a wedding trip later . 
' back with the Met 
`` We are back with the ' Met ' again now that the ' Met ' is back in Chicago '' , bulletins Mrs. Frank S. Sims , president of the women's board of the University of Chicago Cancer Research Foundation . 
The New York Metropolitan Opera Company will be here in May , and the board will sponsor the Saturday night , May 13 , performance of `` Turandot '' as a benefit . 
Birgit Nilsson will be starred . 
`` Housed in the new McCormick Place theater , this should prove to be an exciting evening '' , adds Mrs. Sims . 
The board's last money raising event was a performance by Harry Belafonte -- `` quite off-beat for this group '' , decided some of the members . 
Mrs. Henry T. Sulcer of Winnetka , a new board member , will be chairman of publicity for the benefit . 
Her husband recently was appointed vice president of the university , bringing them back here from the east . 
Parichy-Hamm 
Because of the recent death of the bride's father , Frederick B. Hamm , the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm to John Bruce Parichy will be a small one at noon tomorrow in St. Bernadine's church , Forest Park . 
A small reception will follow in the Oak Park Arms hotel . 
Mrs. Hamm will not come from Vero Beach , Fla. , for the wedding . 
However , Mr. Parichy and his bride will go to Vero Beach on their wedding trip , and will stay in the John G. Beadles' beach house . 
The Beadles formerly lived in Lake Forest . 
Harvey B. Stevens of Kenilworth will give his niece in marriage . 
Mr. and Mrs. Stevens and the bride's other uncles and aunts , the Rush C. Butlers , the Homer E. Robertsons , and the David Q. Porters , will give the bridal dinner tonight in the Stevenses' home . 
Here and there 
The Chicago Press club will fete George E. Barnes , president of the United States Lawn Tennis association , at a cocktail party and buffet supper beginning at 5:30 p.m. tomorrow . 
Later , a bus will carry members to the Chicago Stadium to see Jack Kramer's professional tennis matches at 8 p.m. . 
With loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the Presbyterian-St. Luke's Fashion show still ringing in her ears , its director , Helen Tieken Geraghty ( Mrs. Maurice P. Geraghty ) is taking off tomorrow on a 56 day world trip which should earn her even greater acclaim as director of entertainment for next summer's International Trade fair . 
Armed with letters from embassies to ministers of countries , especially those in the near and far east , Mrs. Geraghty `` will beat the bushes for oriental talent '' . 
`` We ( the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry ) expect to establish closer relations with nations and their cultural activities , and it will be easy as a member of the fair staff to bring in acts '' , explains Mrs. Geraghty . 
`` For instance , Djakarta , Indonesia , has three groups of dancers interested in coming here . 
I'm even going to try to get the whirling dervishes of Damascus '' ! ! 
The last obstacle in Mrs. Geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed out when a representative of Syria called upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of that country -- so newly separated from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't been able to obtain a visa . 
First , Honolulu 
Honolulu will be Mrs. Geraghty's first stop . 
Then Japan , Hong Kong , Manila , India , Pakistan , Damascus , Beirut , and to Rome , London , and Paris `` to look over wonderful talent '' . 
Dec. 22 is the deadline for Mrs. Geraghty's return ; ; 
the Geraghtys' youngest daughter , Molly , bows in the Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next night . 
Molly already has her cotillion gown , and it's fitted , says her mother . 
Also , invitations have been addressed to Molly's debut tea the afternoon of Dec. 29 in the Arts club . 
It won't be a `` tea '' , however , but more of an international folk song festival , with singers from Chicago's foreign groups to sing Christmas songs from around the world . 
The international theme will be continued with the Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys will give in the Racquet club after the tea . 
Miss Abra Prentice's debut supper dance in the Casino will wind up the day . 
Burke-Rostagno 
The Richard S. Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting for the wedding reception for their daughter , Helen Lambert , and the young Italian she met last year while studying in Florence during her junior year at Smith college . 
He is Aldo Rostagno , son of the Guglielmo Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year in Europe . 
The Burkes , who now live in Kankakee , are telling friends of the engagement . 
Miss Burke , a graduate of Miss Hall's school , stayed on in Florence as a career girl . 
Her fiance , who is with a publishing firm , translates many books from English into Italian . 
He will be coming here on business in December , when the wedding is to take place in Wayne . 
Miss Burke will arrive in December also .

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St. . 
The pert , gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo , N.Y. , is a `` civilian '' with the Army . 
Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director . 
The job also covers a number of other items . 
`` Mom '' Marr , as the more than 80 men at the center call her , is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society . 
Her day starts early , but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May , which is National Salvation Army Week , there are plenty ) , schedules to be made or problems to be solved , Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out . 
Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up . 
She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures . 
`` Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men '' , Mrs. Marr explained . 
The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center . 
`` And I bum tickets to everything I can '' , she said . 
`` I've become the greatest beggar in the world '' . 
In addition to the tickets to the movies , sporting events and concerts , Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system . 
Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to `` mother '' , watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society . 
By mid-June , millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land . 
In another four weeks , with schools closed across the nation , the great all-American summer safari will be under way . 
By July 1 , six weeks from now , motel-keepers all over the nation will , by 6 p.m. , be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign , `` No Vacancy '' . 
No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer , probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car , throw suitcases , kids and comic books in the back seat , and head for home . 
And where is `` home '' , that magic place of the heart ? ? 
Ah , that is simple . 
Home is where a man was born , reared , went to school and , most particularly , where grandma is . 
That is where we turn in the good old summertime . 
The land lies ready for the coming onslaught . 
My husband and I , a month ahead of the rush , have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson , Ariz. , to New York City : 
set for influx 
I can testify that motels , service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ) , dog wagons , roadside restaurants , souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting . 
I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene , such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent , far-flung over-night accommodations . 
Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry , but it certainly looks that way from the highway . 
There are motels for all purposes and all tastes . 
There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock , Tex. , as I discovered . 
There the Royal Motel advertises `` all facilities , vented heat , air conditioned , carpeted , free TV , storm cellar '' . 
Many with pools 
Innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( `` swim at your own risk '' is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ) . 
Some even boast two pools , one for adults and one for children . 
But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar . 
Motorists like myself who can remember the old `` tourists accommodated '' signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 , can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business . 
All for $14 ! ! 
At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester , Va. , we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite , an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting , gold and white furniture , pink satin brocade chairs , 24-inch TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels . 
All for $14 . 
That made up for the `` best '' motel in Norman , Okla. , where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture . 
Oxnard , Calif. , will be the home of the Rev. Robert D. Howard and his bride , the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay , who were married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church . 
Parents of the bride are Mr. and Mrs. Ferris M. Gay , 7034 Coronado . 
The bridegroom is the son of Mrs. James Baines of Los Angeles , Calif. , and Carl E. Howard of Santa Monica , Calif. . 
He is a graduate of UCLA and Perkins School of Theology , Aj . 
Dr. W. B. I. Martin officiated , and the bride was given in marriage by her father .

`` A Night in New Orleans '' is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club . 
The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition . 
Mrs. H. J. Grinsfelder is chairman . 
The Louisiana city is known , of course , for its fine food , good music and its colorful hospitality `` and , when guests arrive at Philmont that night '' , says Mrs. Grinsfelder , `` that is exactly what we expect to offer them . 
We've been working for weeks . 
The prospects look great . 
We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats . 
But we can't tell it all now and then have no new excitement later '' . 
Basin Street Beat 
But she does indicate festivities will start early , that a jazz combo will `` give with the Basin Street beat '' during the cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin's orchestra will take over during the dancing . 
As for food , Mrs. Henry Louchheim , chairman of this phase , is a globetrotter who knows good food . 
`` New Orleans '' ? ? 
She says , `` of course I've had the best . 
It is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no R's , so no oysters . 
But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties . 
I know they will be good . 
We've tried them out on the club chef -- or say , he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best '' .

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.M. next Saturday . 
The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000 . 
Howard E. Simpson , the railroad's president , said , `` A drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action '' . 
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates . 
Salary cut and lay-offs 
It will be accomplished in two ways : 1 
A flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers , supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions . 
There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class . 
2 
Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense . 
Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract , it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough , a B. & O. spokesman said . 
Those union members kept on their jobs , therefore , will not take a cut in their wages . 
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job . 
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount Streets . 
The victim , Norman B. Wiley , 38 , of the 900 block North Charles Street , was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery . 
The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money . 
The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit . 
He said the assailant , who was armed with a automatic , entered the taxi at Pennsylvania Avenue and Gold Street . 
In another attack , Samuel Verstandig , 41 , proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken Street , told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him . 
A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel county home . 
The victim Darnell Somerville , Negro , 1 , was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis . 
His sister and brother , Marie Louise , 3 , and John Raymond , Jr. 22 months , were admitted to the hospital . 
The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body . 
Boy in fair condition 
The boy received second-degree burns of the face , neck and back . 
His condition was reported to be fair . 
Police said the children's mother , Mrs. Eleanor Somerville , was visiting next door when the fire occurred . 
The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park , at Jones Station , police said . 
Annapolis , Jan. 7 
-- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what . 
The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams , Jr. , a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent , argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting . 
The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting . 
Cites discrepancies 
Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval . 
`` I hate to have these things come up again and again '' , Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion . 
`` These are the board's minutes . 
I'll write what you tell me to '' . 
For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago . 
It was about that time , a board member said later , that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen , Jr. , State superintendent of schools , told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him . 
The Board of County Commissioners , the Sanitary Commission , the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings . 
Dr. Jenkins notes , however , that most of the school boards in the State do not do so . 
State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli ( D. , First Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt Street . 
He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal ambulance . 
Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side . 
His condition was said to be , `` fair '' . 
Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt Street . 
Barber summoned 
He called Vincent L. Piraro , proprietor of the shop , who summoned police and an ambulance . 
The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are `` deficiencies '' in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible . 
Councilman William D. Schaefer ( D. , Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month . 
Werner criticized 
Conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm , Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here . 
He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December . 
Equipment should be in operation `` almost immediately after the first snowfall '' , Mr. Schaefer said . 
The Councilman , who is the Administration floor leader , also criticized Bernard L. Werner , public works director , for `` halting snow operations '' on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm . 
Sent home for rest 
Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week . 
What he did , Mr. Werner said , was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest . 
Work resumed Wednesday , he said . 
Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan , under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them , should be `` strictly enforced '' . 
Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority , the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas `` not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive '' . 
Recounting personal observations of clearance work , the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes . 
Annapolis , Jan. 7 ( special ) 
-- The 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife , who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home , has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention . 
The victims were H. Malone Dresbach , 47 , and his wife , Shirley , 46 . 
Each had been shot in the back several times with a 
automatic rifle , according to Capt. Elmer Hagner , chief of Anne Arundel detectives . 
Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail . 
The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court . 
Younger son calls police 
Soon after 10 A.M. , when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section , 15 miles south of here on the bay , in response to a call from the Dresbach's other son , Lee , 14 , they found Mrs. Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor . 
Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor , police said . 
The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car . 
The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio . 
Two brothers adopted 
Police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs . 
Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car , with three boys , at a Route 2 service station , just outside Annapolis . 
The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station , police said . 
Annapolis , Jan. 7 
-- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins , his administrative assistant , as Maryland's Secretary of State . 
Mr. Simpkins will move into the post being vacated by Thomas B. Finan , earlier named Attorney General to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert , who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of Appeals . 
Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday . 
Simpkins from Somerset 
Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county , and he and the Governor , also a Somerset countian , have been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child . 
Now 38 , Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947 . 
Five years later , he was awarded the university's degree in law . 
Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958 . 
From the outset of his first term , he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates . 
Maryland contracts for future construction during October totaled $77,389,000 , up to 10 per cent compared to October , 1960 , F. W. Dodge , Dodge Corporation , reported . 
Dodge reported the following breakdown : 
Nonresidential at $20,447,000 , down 28 per cent ; ; 
residential at $47,101,000 , up 100 per cent ; ; 
and heavy engineering at $9,841,000 , down 45 per cent . 
The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000 , a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year . 
A breakdown of the ten-month total showed : 
Nonresidential at $253,355,000 , up 22 per cent ; ; 
residential at $278,877,000 , up 12 per cent ; ; 
and heavy engineering at $102,285,000 , down 33 per cent . 
Residential building consists of houses , apartments , hotels , dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter . 
The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments , which began about six years ago , has more than tripled within that span of time . 
In 1961 , it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction . 
While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction , the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field . 
Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments , Leo J. Pantas , vice president of a hardware manufacturing company , pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house . 
Convenience held key 
`` Convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today . 
Trouble-free , long-life , quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960 '' , Pantas predicted . 
Sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section . 
Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units , in two-story and three-story structures . 
Various of the apartments are of the terrace type , being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct . 
Others , which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs , have balconies . 
The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction . 
Heating is by individual gas-fired , forced warm air systems . 
Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product , according to a study by Johns-Manville Corporation . 
London , Feb. 9 
-- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine , the Dreadnought , and , by implication , of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet , were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring , secret service agents testified today . 
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year . 
It is a killer sub -- that is , a hunter of enemy subs . 
It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus , the world's first atomic submarine . 
Its power unit , however , was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack . 
Five held for trial 
The announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing . 
A full trial was ordered for : 
Two British civil servants , Miss Ethel Gee , 46 , and her newly devoted friend , Harry Houghton , 55 , and divorced . 
They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard . 
Gordon A. Lonsdale , 37 , a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport . 
When arrested , he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping , it was testified . 
Flashed to Moscow 
A shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger , bookseller , and wife , Joyce . 
( In Washington , the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen , an American couple formerly of New York City ) 
. 
In their suburban cottage the crown charges , the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man , usually on the first Saturday evening of each month , and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow , either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books . 
Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing , a printed page , or a manuscript . 
All five pleaded innocent . 
Only Miss Gee asked for bail . 
Her young British lawyer , James Dunlop , pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother , 80 , her maiden aunt , also 80 and bedridden for 20 years , and her uncle , 76 , who once ran a candy shop . 
Refuses to grant bail 
`` I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them '' , said the magistrate , K.J.P. Baraclough . 
The trial will be held , probably the first week of March , in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs , the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s , was sentenced to 14 years in prison . 
Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five , who may have altered history in the 1960s . 
Fuchs , after nine and a half years , was released , being given time off for good behavior . 
He promptly went to communist East Germany . 
The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency , mostly $20 bills , and in British government bonds and stocks . 
`` This is Russian money '' , said Mervin Griffith-Jones for the attorney general's office . 
He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow , Lonsdale the Red paymaster , and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets . 
`` Of highest value '' 
The fact that secrets of the Dreadnought , and thereby of the American undersea fleet , were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier . 
But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare , Capt. George Symonds . 
He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon , Jan. 7 . 
The information , he said , would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy . 
Court cleared 
Just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring , watched for six months , was broken remained untold . 
The British defending lawyers , who today increased from three to four , demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury , the chances of their clients would improve . 
So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour . 
Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet . 
Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed . 
The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack . 
With the machinery went a complete design for the hull . 
The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub , much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it . 
Navy's future involved 
`` Much of the navy's future depends upon her '' , an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August , 1959 , for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station . 
It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work . 
`` Her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines , including the potent Polaris missile submarines '' , the statement went on . 
The atom reactor , water cooled , was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp. . 
Thru development , the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size , and also in complexity , allowing a single propeller to be used , the navy said . 
The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work . 
It was first tried out on a conventional submarine , the Albacore , in 1954 . 
The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built . 
Reputedly it could outrun , underwater , the fastest destroyers . 
It could , reputedly , go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month . 
It was of the hunter-killer type , designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes . 
The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would , if completed and handed back , have given the Kremlin a complete picture `` of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future '' . 
Interested in detector 
The spy ring also was particularly interested in ASDIC , the underwater equipment for detecting submarines , it was testified . 
Range was a vital detail . 
Designs of parts were sought . 
Six radiomen told how , twice on two days after the ring was nabbed , a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling , using signals , times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid . 
Oddly , the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested . 
The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives `` is the product of rumor , combined with malice , and individual enmity '' on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court . 
The three -- Miles J. Cooperman , Sheldon Teller , and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws . 
In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men , Bernard H. Sokol , attorney for the detectives , said that evidence would show that his clients were `` entirely innocent '' . 
' had to know peddlers ' 
`` When they became members of the city police narcotics unit '' , Sokol said , `` they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket . 
They , on occasion , posed as addicts and peddlers '' . 
Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together , Sokol continued , rivalries developed when they were `` aiming at the same criminals '' . 
This , he added , brought about `` petty jealousies '' and `` petty personal grievances '' . 
`` In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy '' , Sokol continued , `` these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations , and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal '' . 
No comments by U.S. 
In opening , D. Arthur Connelly , assistant United States attorney , read the indictment , but made no comments . 
Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt . 
Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler , Otis Sears , 45 , of 6934 Indiana Av. . 
Among other acts , Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears . 
The first witness , Moses Winston Mardis , 5835 Michigan Av. , a real estate agent and former bail bondsman , took the stand after opening statements had been made . 
But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings , two of the defendants , and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy , a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted . 
Buaford Robinson , 23 , of 7026 Stewart Av. , a CTA bus driver , was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st Street and South Park Way . 
Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee . 
His losses included his money bag , containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck . 
Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash Avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High School , 30th Street and South Park Way , and began `` skylarking '' . 
When 51st Street was reached , Robinson related , he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the CTA supervisor . 
As he left the bus with his money bag , Robinson added , the largest youth accosted him , a quarrel ensued , and the youth knocked him down . 
Then the youths fled with his money . 
Mrs. Blanche Dunkel , 60 , who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law , Ervin Lang , then 28 , appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members , John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier . 
She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison , but former Gov. Stratton commuted her term to 75 years , making her eligible for parole , as one of his last acts in office . 
Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934 . 
It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place . 
The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20 . 
The defendant , William L. Stickney 3 , 23 , of 3211 Park pl. , Evanston , who pleaded guilty to reckless driving , also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month . 
Stickney is a salesman for Plee-Zing , Inc. , 2544 Green Bay Rd. , Evanston , a food brokerage and grocery chain firm , of which his father , William L. Jr. , is president . 
Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart Avenue at Central Street . 
At Jenks Street , Simms said , the car skidded completely around , just missed two parked cars , and sped east in Jenks . 
The car spun around again , Simms said , before Stickney could turn north in Prairie Avenue , and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie . 
St. Johns , Mich. , April 19 . 
-- A jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach . 
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion . 
He returned to his cell in the county jail , where he has been held since his arrest last July , without a word to his court-appointed attorney , Jack Walker , or his guard . 
Stepson vindicated 
The verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson , Vincent Hengesbach , 54 , who was tried for the same crime in December , 1958 , and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict . 
Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31 , 1958 . 
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since . 
When the verdict came in against his young neighbor , Hengesbach said : 
`` I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed . 
Still , I don't wish to appear happy at somebody else's misfortune '' . 
Lives on welfare 
Hengesbach , who has been living on welfare recently , said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia , 27 miles southwest of here . 
Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958 . 
Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police . 
He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach . 
However , the confession , which was the only evidence against him , was retracted before the trial . 
Charges in doubt 
Assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis , who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases , said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl . 
Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing . 
Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation . 
Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure . 
Locked in motel 
A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation . 
The jury , which was locked up in a motel overnight , was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced . 
The jury foreman , Mrs. Olive Heideman , of rural Elsie , said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence . 
She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession was valid . 
The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter . 
The verdict came three hours later . 
Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read . 
The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week . 
A Sterling Township family of six surviving children , whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children , found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends . 
While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's duties , fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski family , 34220 Viceroy . 
Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski , 42 , died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother , Mrs. Mary Pankowski , in the adjoining suburb of Warren . 
Services tomorrow 
Funeral services for Mrs. Kowalski and her daughter , Christine , 11 , who died of burns at the same hospital Monday , have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in St. Anne's Catholic Church , 31978 Mound , in Warren . 
The mother and daughter , who will be buried side by side in Mt. Olivet Cemetery , rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home , 31730 Mound , Warren . 
Mrs. Pankowski , 61 , remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion , which occurred while Mrs. Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile Road East . 
Held candle 
Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother , because the flat lacked electricity . 
Christine's twin sister , Patricia , and Darlene Kowalski , 8 , escaped with minor burns . 
They are home now with the other Kowalski children , Vicky , 14 ; ; 
Dennis , 6 ; ; 
Eleanor , 2 ; ; 
and Bernardine , 1 . 
`` All we have left in the world is one another , and we must stay together the way Mother wanted '' , Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon . 
Kowalski , a roofer who seldom worked last winter , already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills . 
A135 donated 
Neighbor women , such as Mrs. Sidney Baker , 2269 Serra , Sterling Township , have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski's sister-in-law , Mrs. Anna Kowalski , 22111 David , East Detroit . 
Another neighbor , Mrs. Frank C. Smith , 2731 Pall Mall , Sterling Township , surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs . 
John C. Houghton , president of the Tareytown Acres Homeowners Association , followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family . 
Students help out 
Houghton said 6 p.m. Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision , which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile Road East . 
He said contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box 553 , Warren Village Station . 
Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior High School , 5155 Fourteen Mile road east . 
Principal Clayton W. Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today , and revealed that Y-Teen Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs. Kowalski . 
Funds from dances 
Student Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago , and another dance for Fuhrmann's 770 students this Friday night . 
`` Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort , started largely among the students themselves , because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family , Pohly said . 
There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School , 3505o Dequindre , which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine . 
Expresses thanks 
Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday . 
But today he wanted to make a public statement . 
`` I never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family . 
I wasn't sure there were such people anywhere in the world . 
I'll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them '' . 
An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist . 
Patrolman George Kimmell , of McClellan Station , said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph Sisk , 9230 Vernor east , a third grader at the Scripps School , for his assistance in the case . 
Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk . 
Gets car number 
Kimmell ordered the driver to back up , watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly `` took off at high speed '' , he said , narrowly missing him . 
Commandeering a passing car , Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle , but lost it in traffic . 
Returning to the school crossing , the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver , a neighbor , and had obtained the license number . 
The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees , 17 , of 2433 McClellan , currently on probation and under court order not to drive . 
Given 15 days 
He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic Judge George T. Murphy , who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House of Correction . 
The jail sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June . 
The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today . 
Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire . 
Help asked 
In Vientiane , the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its `` friends and neighbors '' for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom . 
Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home . 
He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened , sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire . 
A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5 , he said . 
Plea for arms 
The Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana . 
He indicated that requests would be made for more U.S. arms and more U.S. military advisers . 
He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens . 
One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body . 
A note making the request was handed to U.S. Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown . 
Heavy support 
The Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched , heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam . 
The minister , describing the attacks which led up to the appeal , said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near Thakhek , in southern-central Laos . 
There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources . 
In the past such government claims have been found exaggerated . 
Havana , April 19 . 
-- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators . 
A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair . 
The executions took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar Del Rio , where the executions took place . 
Arms plot charged 
The broadcast said Anderson , a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman , and McNair , of Miami , were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels . 
Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel Castro's regime . 
Anderson's wife and four children live in Miami . 
McNair , 25 , was seized March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles in Pinar Del Rio , about 35 miles from Havana . 
Report others held 
At least 20 other Americans were reported to have been arrested in a mass political roundup . 
Among them were a number of newsmen , including Henry Raymont , of United Press International , and Robert Berrellez , of Associated Press . 
So many Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift jails . 
More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested -- 100 of them Roman Catholic priests . 
Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state , few emerge in the West to tell about it . 
M. Kegham -- the name is a pseudynom -- was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( ARF ) -- two reasons the Communists put him away when they arrived in 1945 . 
Today , M. Kegham was in Detroit , en route to join his wife and children in California . 
Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible . 
`` Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race '' , board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated . 
But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes . 
The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law , tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated . 
`` Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning , of true university grade , and meet its financial obligations , without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions '' , the statement said . 
The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation . 
An Emory spokesman indicated , however , that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws . 
The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if , among other criteria , `` all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people , and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people '' . 
At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies , but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state . 
Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church . 
Some church leaders , both clerical and lay , have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation . 
Urged in 1954 
The student newspaper , The Emory Wheel , as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation . 
`` From its beginning '' , the trustees' statement said Friday , `` Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning . 
Teaching , research and study , according to highest standards , under Christian influence , are paramount in the Emory University policy . 
`` As a private institution , supported by generous individuals , Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education . 
`` There is not now , nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race , color or creed . 
Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned , Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students , and others seeking applications from prospective students , and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university , irrespective of race , color or creed . 
Corporate existence 
`` On the other hand , Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia . 
`` When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities , Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race , color or creed , continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education '' . 
A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street , NE , police said . 
The dead youth was identified as Robert E. Sims , 19 , of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir. , Aj . 
Patrolman G. E. Hammons said the car evidently slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the pole . 
The other occupants were James Willard Olvey , 18 , of 963 Ponce De Leon Ave. , NE , and Larry Coleman Barnett , 19 , of 704 Hill St. , SE , both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises . 
The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and `` stand-ins '' if negotiations failed . 
The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights . 
' intend to attend ' 
`` We intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year '' , the identically worded letters said . 
The letters set a Nov. 15 deadline for the start of negotiations . 
They indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate . 
Downtown and art theater managers and owners , contacted Friday night for comment on the COAHR request , said they had no knowledge of such a letter , and that it was not in the Friday mail . 
However , three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend . 
Gather here 
The COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday . 
Several theater operators said , however , that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair . 
Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago . 
Charles A. Black , COAHR chairman , said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct. 31 but had failed to show up . 
He declined to name the three . 
Friday's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting . 
Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend , the letters said , would be considered a `` sign of indifference '' . 
Black said COAHR `` hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action , but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal '' 
A prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that `` extensive research by COAHR into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits '' 
Besides managers of downtown theaters , the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead .

A 24-year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after breaking into the home of relatives in search of his wife , hitting his uncle with a rock and assaulting two police officers who tried to subdue him , police said . 
Patrolmen J. W. Slate and A. L. Crawford Jr. said they arrested Ronald M. Thomas , of 1671 Nakoma St. , NW , after he assaulted the officers . 
Police account 
The officers gave this account : 
Thomas early Sunday went to the home of his uncle and aunt , Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Thomas , 511 Blanche St. , NW , looking for his wife , Margaret Lou Thomas , 18 , and their 11-month-old baby . 
The younger Thomas ripped a screen door , breaking the latch , and after an argument struck his uncle with a rock , scratching his face . 
He also struck his aunt and wife , and during the melee the baby also suffered scratches . 
When police arrived the man was still violent , Slate said . 
Attacks officer 
He attacked one of the officers and was restrained . 
About five minutes later he jumped up , Slate said , and struck the two policemen again . 
He was then subdued and placed in the police car to be taken to Grady Hospital for treatment of scratches received in the melee . 
Then he attacked the two officers again and was again restrained , Slate related . 
Slate said he and Crawford received cuts and scratches and their uniforms were badly torn . 
Thomas was charged with four counts of assault and battery . 
Two counts of assault on an officer , resisting arrest , disturbance and cursing , police said . 
A hearing was set for 30 a.m. Tuesday . 
Mrs. Mary Self , who knows more than any other person about the 5,000 city employes for whom she has kept personnel records over the years , has closed her desk and retired . 
Over the weekend , Mrs. Self , personnel clerk , was a feted and honored guest of the Atlanta Club , organization of women employes at City Hall . 
After 18 years in the personnel office , she has taken a disability pension on advice of her doctors . 
As personnel clerk , she handled thousands of entries , ranging from appointments to jobs , to transfers to other employments , to pensions . 
`` I have enjoyed it and will feel a bit lost at least for a while '' , she said wistfully Friday . 
One of the largest crowds in the club's history turned out to pay tribute to Mrs. Self and her service . 
Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading pest . 
The department is planning to expand its eradication program soon to four additional counties -- Troup , Pierce , Bryan and Bulloch -- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants , according to W. E. Blasingame state entomologist . 
Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical , heptachlor , over 30,000 acres in Troup , 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties . 
The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and Jones counties , over 37,679 acres . 
The department has just finished treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon . 
Also being treated are Houston , Bleckley , Tift , Turner and Dodge counties , Blasingame said . 
The fire ant is thought to infest approximately two million acres of land in Georgia , attacking crops , young wildlife and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic to its venom , Blasingame said . 
The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week . 
This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase of a traffic survey on the North Expressway . 
Students have been using electric computers and high speed movie cameras during the study . 
Perhaps the engineers can find out what causes all the congestion and suggest methods to eliminate it . 
Incidentally , 14th Street and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight hours . 
It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue , NE ; ; 
the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways and Jones Avenue and Marietta Street , Aj . 
Four persons died in Georgia weekend traffic crashes , two of them in a fiery crash near Snellville , the State Patrol said Sunday .

Salem ( special ) 
-- For a second month in a row , Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need , the state public welfare commission was told Friday . 
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in GA category , for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary . 
William Smythe , director of field service , told the commissioners that Multnomah , as of Aug. 22 , had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category , leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month . 
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month , this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000 . 
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month , Smythe said . 
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received , however . 
Board oks pact 
The commission , meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners , Roy Webster , of Hood River , and Dr. Ennis Keizer , of North Bend , approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past . 
The contract with Ray Field , who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape , would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month . 
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes . 
Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program , the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period . 
But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles , and he said he personally `` regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past '' . 
He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing , `` and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave '' . 
Salary termed modest 
Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government . 
He also said that the salary , in terms of going rates in the field , was `` modest '' in terms of the man's responsibility . 
The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed , he said , and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program . 
`` Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract '' ? ? 
Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck , representative from Multnomah County , of the commission chairman , Joseph E. Harvey Jr. . 
`` My feeling at the moment '' , he said , `` is that we have no alternative , irrespective of some of the arguments about him . 
The continued operation of this program depends on having his service '' . 
Harvey criticized 
Mrs. Peck , later joined by the commission's vice-chairman , Mrs. Lee Patterson , took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday . 
A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service , of which Harvey is president , quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem , instead of `` crippling '' the agency , had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses , with the key being improved communications between F & A and the commission staff . 
`` I rather resent '' , she said , `` you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this . 
I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : That the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people . 
The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles '' . 
Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare '' .

Birmingham , Ala. -- ( AP ) 
-- The FBI yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the `` Freedom Rider '' bus burning trial four weeks ago . 
U.S. Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint , charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury . 
He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker , 59 , a farmer of Hartselle , Ala. . 
Eight men were tried together in U.S. District Court in Anniston , Ala. , on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders . 
The bus was burned outside Anniston . 
One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal . 
A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict . 
The arrest of Mr. Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case . 
The first incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H. Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts . 
He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case . 
Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial . 
Neither was seated on the jury . 
Then , when the case went to the jury , the judge excused one of the jurors , saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened . 
The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient . 
The judge replaced the juror with an alternate . 
No formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents . 
At the opening of the trial , the jury panel was questioned as a group by Mr. Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections . 
One member of the panel -- not Mr. Parker -- indicated he had been a member of the KKK at one time . 
He was not seated on the jury . 
The perjury charge against Mr. Parker carries a maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction .

Asilomar , March 26 
Vast spraying programs conducted by `` technicians with narrow training and little wisdom '' are endangering crops and wildlife , Carl W. Buchheister , president of the National Audubon Society , said today . 
`` It is like handing a loaded automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play '' , he commented . 
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target , the fire ant . 
`` But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop '' , he said . 
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming . 
There have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service , whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training , he added . 
`` The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who , forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents , are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries '' , Buchheister told the delegates . 
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying , Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill , creation of national seashore parks , including Point Reyes ; ; 
preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; ; 
a pesticides co-ordination act ; ; 
stronger water pollution control programs , and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil . 
The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society . 
Mrs. Norman Livermore , president of the Marin Conservation League , handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister , president of the Society . 
The presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall , College of Marin , Kentfield . 
Buchheister pledged the land would be an `` inviolate '' sanctuary for all birds , animals and plants . 
Seventeen years ago today , German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a V-1 rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber . 
The World War 2 , German bomber rolled down a runway and took off . 
The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip . 
This had never been done before . 
Now a quiet-spoken , middle-aged man , Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale , where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile . 
He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944 . 
`` The first two pilots had crashed '' , he said . 
`` I had developed the machines and therefore knew them . 
It was time to go up myself '' . 
Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret `` Reichenberg project '' , which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war . 
About 200 of the special V-1 rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead . 
The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe . 
The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight . 
Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism , the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude . 
At 12,000 feet , Fiedler signaled `` release '' , and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel . 
To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck , hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h. . 
It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile . 
`` She flew beautifully '' , said Fiedler . 
`` There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow . 
I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip '' . 
Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons , Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage . 
He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield . 
Moments later the V-1 skimmed across the landing strip , edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed . 
Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles . 
The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb . 
Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water , striking below the waterline of individual ships . 
A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers , but the project was halted before the end of the war , and the missiles later fell into Allied hands . 
Now a family man with three children , Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale . 
His spare time is spent in soaring gliders . 
`` It's so quiet '' , he said , `` so slow , serene -- and so challenging '' .

Dr. Albert Schweitzer , world-famous theologian and medical missionary , has endorsed an Easter March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale . 
Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service , a Quaker organization , will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p.m. Saturday . 
In a letter to the American Friends Service , Dr. Schweitzer wrote : 
`` Leading Nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out . 
`` They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack . 
The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons ; ; 
otherwise no peace is possible . 
`` Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger ; ; 
therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency '' . 
A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein , 47 , who collected big fees as a `` labor consultant '' and operator of a janitors' service . 
Before he testified for 20 minutes , Stein , who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr. , admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums . 
Glimco a buddy 
Among his gangland buddies , he said , were Joseph ( Joey ) Glimco , a mob labor racketeer , and four gang gambling chiefs , Gus ( Slim ) Alex , Ralph Pierce , Joe ( Caesar ) DiVarco , and Jimmy ( Monk ) Allegretti . 
Another hoodlum , Louis Arger , drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor firm , the National Maintenance company , in three years ending in 1959 , Stein disclosed in an interview . 
`` I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier '' , Stein said . 
`` But Arger never was able to produce it , so I cut him off my payroll '' . 
Connection is sought 
Other witnesses , after appearances before the jury , which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations , disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters , including Glimco and Alex . 
The federal lawyers , according to their witnesses , also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant . 
Under scrutiny , two of the witnesses said , were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St. . 
The company supplies janitors and workmen for McCormick Place and factories , liquor firms , and other businesses . 
Lee a witness 
Among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee , director of McCormick Place ; ; 
Jerome Leavitt , a partner in the Union Liquor company , 3247 S. Kedzie Av. , Dominic Senese , a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo , onetime gang chief ; ; 
and Frank W. Pesce , operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm , the Best Sanitation and Supply company , 1215 Blue Island Av. . 
Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in McCormick Place . 
Stein's fee , Lee said , was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay . 
Stein estimated this amount at `` about $1,500 or $1,600 a month '' . 
A $12,500 payment 
Leavitt , as he entered the jury room , said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for `` labor consultant work '' with five unions which organized Leavitt's workers . 
Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local , the teamsters union , a salesman's union , the janitors' union , and a bottling workers' union . 
Government attorneys , Leavitt said , have questioned him closely about `` five or six loans '' totaling about $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year . 
All of the loans , in amounts up to $5,000 each , have been repaid by Stein , according to Leavitt . 
Stein said he needed the money , Leavitt said , to `` meet the payroll '' at National Maintenance company . 
The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island Av. . 
The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday . 
The reading , which has been watched with interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday , was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday , a level far below the danger point , according to the board of health . 
The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week . 
A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation . 
Curtis Allen Huff , 41 , of 1630 Lake Av. , Wilmette , was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association , 1 S. Dearborn St. , where he formerly was employed as an attorney . 
Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20,000 , altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10,000 . 
Lien payments involved 
Huff's attorney , Antone F. Gregorio , quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff , as attorney for the loan association , in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages . 
Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay `` the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living '' . 
Huff , who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year , said that his private practice was not lucrative . 
Huff lives with his wife , Sue , and their four children , 6 to 10 years old , in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage . 
Charge lists 3 checks 
The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber , an attorney for the association . 
The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18 . 
On that date , according to Gregorio , Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av. . 
There , Gregorio said , Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense . 
Later , Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House , using a credit card . 
All bounced . 
When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there Monday , hotel officials called police .

-- Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution , it was announced today . 
Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue , which was sold to the public during the past week . 
For many reasons , the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous . 
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; ; 
it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell . 
Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25 , and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many . 
In fact , very few customers , anywhere in the nation , were able to get more than 100 shares . 
Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares , for all of their customers . 
A measure of how hot the stock was , can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began . 
The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share . 
The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler , Guerin & Turner , the managing underwriter , was at $17 a share . 
And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share . 
But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market . 
Indeed , from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January , the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up . 
Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation , all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50 , with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share ) . 
There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering . 
`` We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas . 
Cable confirmation '' , it said translated . 
But E.G.T. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares . 
After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone . 
But the result of it all was , E.G.T. partner Dean Guerin believes , an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation . 
`` I feel confident the stock will qualify for the ' national list ' '' , he said , meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country . 
He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do . 
But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one ? ? 
The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances . 
First , the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months , driving stocks of all kinds up . 
As a result , it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings , to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ) . 
Second , the `` potato chip industry '' has caught the fancy of investors lately , and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market . 
Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months , both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at , and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up . 
And third , the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a `` growth '' industry in the public mind of late . 
Foods , which long had been considered `` recession resistant '' but hardly dynamic stocks , have been acting like growth stocks , going to higher price-earnings ratios . 
The potato chip industry these days is growing , not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods , but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger . 
The history of the U.S. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days . 
Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives , men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest . 
But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms . 
So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock , and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito . 
All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is . 
Now , if Morton's newest product , a corn chip known as Chip-o's , turns out to sell as well as its stock did , the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to . 
Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies , valued in the millions of dollars . 
More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at Sherman . 
It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history . 
The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars . 
It weighs in the tons , so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year . 
A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000 , and it's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U.S. and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area . 
The Murray Co. of Texas , Inc. , originated in Dallas in 1896 . 
They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's . 
More than 700 employees make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown . 
Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners , and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based firm . 
The Continental Gin Co. began operations in Dallas in 1899 . 
The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834 . 
Headquarters is in Birmingham , Ala. . 
Factories are located here and in Prattville , Ala. . 
About 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more than 200 employes . 
The company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world . 
Hardwicke-Etter Co. of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment . 
The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co. . 
They export also . 
The company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies . 
In 1930 , they began making cotton processing equipment . 
Presently , Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people , depending on the season of the year . 
The Lummus Cotton Gin Co. has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912 . 
Factory operations are in Columbus , Ga. . 
The district office here employs about 65 . 
The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co. and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here . 
The cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system , which turns out a complete ginning system , began operations in 1959 . 
Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock . 
The John E. Mitchell Co. began work in Dallas in 1928 . 
The firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton , driers , and heaters , and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment . 
The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation . 
Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people . 
They export cotton ginning machinery . 
The Hinckley Gin Supply Co. is a maker of `` overhead equipment '' . 
This includes driers , cleaners , burr extractors , separators and piping that's located above gin stands in a complete gin . 
The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt , including the Mississippi Delta . 
The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co. has home offices and factory facilities here . 
They make gin saws and deal in parts , supplies and some used gin machinery . 
The Stacy Co. makes cleaning and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas . 
They've been in Dallas since 1921 . 
Cotton Belt Gin Service , Inc. of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago . 
They distribute equipment in 11 states . 
The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such as belting , bearings , etc. . 
Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy . 
New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year . 
Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000 mark in March for the first time this year . 
Totaling 3,399 , sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2,963 . 
However , compared with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441 , this March was off 23 per cent . 
On a quarter-to-quarter comparison , the first quarter of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's 3-month total of 11,744 . 
This year-to-year decline for Dallas County closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the U.S. for first three months of 1961 were about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier . 
With the March pickup , dealers are optimistic that the April-June quarter will equal or top last year . 
The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter . 
On the local level , compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars . 
Only three standard models -- Buick , Chrysler , and Mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in March sales in the county . 
The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas County high schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel as the club winds up its annual Distributive Education project . 
Now in its third year , the program is designed to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing and salesmanship . 
Business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom instruction in these fields . 
More than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis . 
Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T. Owens , national sales manager for Isodine Pharmical Corp. of New York . 
The 33 honored students are : Mike Trigg , Raymond Arrington , and Ronald Kaminsky of Bryan Adams , Janice Whitney , Fil Terral , and Carl David Page of W. H. Adamson ; ; 
Bill Burke , Tommie Freeman , and Lawrence Paschall of N. R. Crozier Tech. Paulah Thompson , Gerald Kestner , and Nancy Stephenson of Hillcrest ; ;

The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban renewal proposals , particularly their effect on the Federal Housing Administration , came under fire in Dallas last week . 
The Administration's proposals , complex and sweeping as they are , all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core , stated Caron S. Stallard , first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America . 
Santa Barbara 
-- `` The present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn '' , Beryl W. Sprinkel , economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank , Chicago , predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn. , California group , conference . 
Another speaker , William H. Draper , Jr. , former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper , Gaither & Anderson , urged the U.S. to `` throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more '' . 
He urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations . 
' not flash in pan ' 
Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a `` temporary flash in the pan '' but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern . 
`` In view of the current expansion , which promises to be substantial '' he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months , but `` there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960 '' . 
Thesis refuted 
Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth , declaring that this pessimism `` is based on very limited and questionable evidence '' . 
Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth '' , he said `` it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery '' . 
Danger cited 
He cautioned that `` the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation '' . 
The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it `` even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958 '' . 
The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion , he said , was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike . 
Sacrifices needed 
Draper declared , `` As I see it , this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today . 
We must justify our heritage . 
We must be ready for any needed sacrifice '' . 
He said that from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration , that `` Russia respects our show of strength , but that presently we're not acting as we should and must '' . 
He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action , and noted that in war `` you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do '' . 
While he declined to suggest , how , he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro , `` for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere . 
Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that '' . 
New York ( AP ) 
-- Stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery , erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks . 
Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for `` support level '' represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average . 
It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages . 
Some good news 
Although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news . 
A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month . 
Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year , paving the way for lower taxes . 
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87 . 
Of 1,253 issues traded , 695 advanced and 354 declined . 
New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14 . 
Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day . 
Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday . 
A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G. Peterson , head of one of the world's greatest camera firms , in a key address before the American Marketing Assn. . 
However , Peterson , president of Bell & Howell , warned 800 U.S. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador , that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and `` unconventional wisdom '' . 
Creations needed 
`` As we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal , management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed '' , Peterson said . 
`` With this kind of new product log-jam , the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically '' . 
The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past , but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs . 
Nothing to fear 
Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas . 
He cited , as an example , how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs , by improving its production know-how and technology . 
He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany , with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market . 
Election of Howard L. Taylor to membership in Pacific Coast Stock Exchange , effective Tuesday , has been announced by Thomas P. Phelan , president of the exchange . 
Taylor , president and voting stockholder of Taylor and Co. , Beverly Hills , has been active in the securities business since 1925 . 
Union Oil Co. of California Tuesday offered $120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by Dillon , Read & Co. , to raise money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp. . 
Gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash , according to Union . 
Under the new offering , only $60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares . 
Due in 1986 
The new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million worth of 4-7/8 debentures , due June 1 , 1986 , at 100% , and $60 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due June 1 , 1991 , at 100% . 
The convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by June 1 , 1966 ; ; 
$70 by 1971 ; ; 
$75 by 1976 ; ; 
$80 by 1981 ; ; 
$85 by 1986 , and $90 thereafter . 
New York ( AP ) 
-- American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly solid rise but here also trading dwindled . 
Volume was 1.23 million shares , down from Monday's 1.58 million . 
Gains of 2-3/4 were posted for Teleprompter and Republic Foil . 
Fairchild Camera and Kawecki Chemical gained 2-1/2 each . 
Question 
-- I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund on Oct. 23 , 1959 , and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on Feb. 8 , 1960 . 
Something has gone wrong some place . 
I am getting dividends on only 50 shares . 
In other words , I am getting only half the dividends I should . 
Answer 
-- Write to the fund's custodian bank -- the First National Bank of Jersey City , N.J. . 
That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund , Fundamental Investors , Diversified Investment Fund and Television-Electronics Fund . 
The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things . 
But it seems that this `` electronic brain '' wasn't `` programmed '' correctly . 
This resulted in a great number of errors . 
And letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders . 
I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation . 
At that time , the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand . 
They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected `` within 60 days '' . 
That 60-day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds , complaining about mistakes in their accounts . 
Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected . 
Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank .

Washington ( AP ) 
-- Alfred Hayes , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , said Tuesday `` there is no present need for far-reaching reforms '' which would basically alter the international financial system . 
Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations , `` there is no reason , in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future '' . 
Washington ( UPI ) 
-- New York Central Railroad president Alfred E. Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads merge . 
Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger , but could possibly be an ultimate effect . 
The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the C & O's request to control and then merge with the B & Aj . 
`` All these kind of things weaken us '' , Perlman said . 
Bad condition 
Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. , testified the B & O was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad . 
`` The financial situation of the Baltimore & Ohio , has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s '' , he told the hearing . 
C & O president Walter J. Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex case . 
The New York Central also has asked the ICC to permit it to gain control of the B & Aj . 
Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger . 
The proposed C & O-B & O railroad would make it the hemisphere's second largest . 
Washington ( AP ) 
-- The government's short-term borrowing costs rose with Tuesday's weekly offering of Treasury bills . 
On $1.1 billion of 90-day bills , the average yield was 2.325% . 
The rate a week ago was 2.295% . 
Washington , March 11 ( UPI ) . 
-- `` Consumer uncertain about economic conditions '' . 
This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing Center . 
Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were `` resistance to high interest rates , cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed , shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify '' . 
Increase expected 
The poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference . 
It disclosed that the builders : 
Expect their own production volume , and presumably sales , to jump 30 percent in 1961 . 
Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257,700 non-farm housing starts . 
The industry has said 1960 was a poor year . 
Starts were down 20 percent from 1959 . 
Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry ? ? 
Leaders of industry 
The reason , says the Housing Center , is that the builders invited to the intentions conference `` are generally among the more successful businessmen , and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders '' . 
Elburn , Ill. 
-- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : `` We've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more . 
We sold only four pickers all last year '' . 
Gus Ehlers , competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community , says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier . 
`` Before then , my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20% '' , he says . 
Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business , farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas . 
Paradoxically , the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output . 
Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934 , farmers , with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather , are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines . 
Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently . 
The higher price supports provided by the new legislation , together with rising prices for farm products , are pushing up farm income , making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery . 
Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year . 
`` In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year '' , says Mark V. Keeler , farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co. . 
For the year to date , sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960 . 
Two of three report gains 
Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states , two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier , with the increases ranging from 5% to 50% . 
Not all sections are showing an upswing , however ; ; 
the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend . 
The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry . 
The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally . 
Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products . 
More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks , buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances , chemicals and other products . 
Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago , dealers report . 
`` Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale '' , says Jack Martin , who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux City , Iowa . 
`` This morning , we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model . 
Last year , we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine '' . 
Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; ; 
in August of 1960 , he sold seven . 
Dealers' stocks down 
With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago , the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers . 
For example , farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier , Mr. Keeler reports . 
Tractor production at Massey-Ferguson , Ltd. , of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier , says John Staiger , vice president . 
With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements . 
Merritt D. Hill , Ford Motor Co. vice president , says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers . 
Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961 , retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959 . 
The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ; ; 
the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and , as a result , reduced the immediate need for machines . 
Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects . 
Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average , three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960 . 
The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects . 
Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments , well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960 . 
Price support loans may total another $1 billion this year . 
With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960 , farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion , $1.5 billion above 1960's record high . 
Net income may reach $12.7 billion , up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953 . 
The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month , reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July . 
Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling . 
The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined . 
The company , in figuring its taxable earnings , deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products . 
Such `` depletion allowances '' , in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets . 
The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground , not to the revenue from finished products . 
A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact , on prior-year returns still under review , for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products . 
The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone . 
President Kennedy , in signing the relief measure into law , stressed he regarded it as an exception . 
`` My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries '' , the President said . 
Charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.R.S. . 
The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date , purpose , amount and other particulars of the contribution . 
Requests for substantiation , the Service indicated , can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return , such as tickets to a show . 
In such an instance , revenuers stressed , the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received . 
A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested . 
A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax , under Federal law , on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation . 
Louisiana , however , collected an income tax on the profits from the sale . 
The corporation , in filing its final Federal income return , claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense , as permitted under U.S. tax law . 
The Revenue Service disallowed the claim , invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income . 
The Tax Court rejected this view . 
It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations . 
The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.R.S. ruling on the subject . 
The Service has not said what its next step will be . 
Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency . 
It provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get , after serving a two-year hitch without pay , will be spread over both years , not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received . 
The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and `` kicked back '' to the company's advertising manager , the Tax Court ruled . 
The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager . 
The Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these `` kickbacks '' were not his income though they passed through his hands . 
The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved , commenting : `` It is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction '' . 
A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel . 
The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliances . 
Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income . 
A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls , for example , may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage . 
She would be taxed on the pensions when received , of course , but the company's contributions would be tax-free . 
A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement , experts warn , is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income . 
In that event , they note , the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law . 
Possible upshots : The company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments , or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made . 
State briefs : Voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area . 
Colorado has a 2% sales tax . 
Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax . 
The Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales , made at cost to an oil company , by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent . 
The state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales . 
The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities . 
Washington 
-- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months , the Government reported . 
The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April , down 1% from the March level of more than $18.2 billion . 
April sales also were 5% below those of April last year , when volume reached a record for any month , $18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One ) . 
The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year , two weeks earlier than in 1960 , and pre-Easter buying was pushed into March . 
Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March . 
Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before , which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17.8 billion . 
Greer Garson , world-famous star of stage , screen and television , will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession . 
As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season . 
She will receive the 1961 `` Oscar '' at the 24th annual Neiman-Marcus Exposition , Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel . 
The only woman recipient , Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi , creator of chic , beautiful women's fashions ; ; 
Harry Rolnick , president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; ; 
Sydney Wragge , creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier , designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris , France , whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry . 
The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus , president of Neiman-Marcus , Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center . 
The attractive Greer Garson , who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles , prefers timeless classical designs . 
Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because `` It's unlike me '' . 
In private life , Miss Garson is Mrs. E. E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas , where they maintain an apartment , to their California home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos , New Mexico . 
Therefore , her wardrobe is largely mobile , to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle . 
Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants `` all of her pictures by one painter '' . 
A favorite is Norman Norell , however . 
She likes his classic chemise . 
Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell , a black and white organdy and silk jersey . 
Irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette . 
She also likes the femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and Helen Rose . 
Balenciaga is her favorite European designer . 
`` I bought my first dress from him when I was still a struggling young actress '' , she reminisces . 
`` I like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion '' . 
Black and white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks , reds , blues and greens . 
Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent , Greer Garson was born in County Down , Ireland . 
Her mother was a Greer and her father's family came from the Orkney Isles . 
Reared in England , she studied to be a teacher , earned several scholarships and was graduated with honors from the University of London . 
She took postgraduate work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned to London to work on market research with an advertising firm . 
Her acting began with the Birmingham Repertory Company and she soon became the toast of the West End . 
Among stage performances was a starring role in `` Golden Arrow '' directed by Noel Coward . 
It was during `` Old Music '' at the St. James Theater that Hollywood's Louis B. Mayer spotted her . 
After signing a motion-picture contract , she came to America and had `` Goodbye , Mr. Chips '' as her first assignment after a year's wait . 
Other triumphs include `` Random Harvest '' , `` Madame Curie '' , `` Pride and Prejudice '' , `` The Forsythe Saga '' and `` Mrs. Miniver '' ( which won her the Academy Award in 1943 ) . 
Honors that have come to Greer Garson are countless . 
Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in `` Sunrise at Campobello '' . 
She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from `` Captain Brassbound's Conversion '' to `` Camille '' . 
She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks in London , a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states . 
She is adept at skeet shooting , trout fishing , Afro-Cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology . 
She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts . 
She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations . 
Both Miss Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in New Mexico . 
Back in college , today's handsome Gander was the only male member of a Texas Tech class on food . 
The pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long -- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy . 
Last October he gave a public speech in Washington , D.C. entitled `` Are Women Here To Stay '' ? ? 
So you can see that Gerald G. Ramsey , director of SMU's food services , is not the ordinary type of craven , women-trodden chef . 
He is apt to rear back and claim his rights . 
Ramsey , as SMU's food wrangler , buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week . 
Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden ! ! 
He also dishes up 3,000 snacks . 
And he operates three cafeterias in the Student Center , along with McElvaney Dining Hall and the athlete's tables . 
Ramsey , 6-3 , 195 and ruggedly slim , says , `` I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me to cook '' . 
He was in charge of the Hockaday School meals from 1946 to 1950 , before he moved to Aj . 
And you'll notice that in both places , there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line . 
What does he feed his SMU football mastodons at the training table ? ? 
`` Mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat '' , says Ramsey . 
So he hides the mayonnaise . 
And to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress , he bans all highly flavored condiments . 
What do the pretty SMU girls like on their plates ? ? 
`` Pretty much hamburger , hotdogs , steak and , at night , maybe pizza '' , says the handsome food expert . 
`` Unfortunately , there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower '' . 
Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman , Henry Cabot Lodge , the King of Morocco , Clement Atlee and other shiny characters . 
Once four Tibetan monks , in their saffron robes , filed through the cafeteria line . 
`` They aren't supposed to look at women , you know '' , Ramsey recalled . 
`` What with all those pretty girls around , they had a hard time '' . 
Chicken Cadillac 
Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest . 
Salt and pepper each breast . 
Dip in melted butter and roll in flour . 
Place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan . 
Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 F. until lightly brown . 
Add enough warmed cream , seasoned to taste with onion juice , to about half cover the chicken breasts . 
Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer . 
While this is baking , saute mushrooms , fresh or canned , in butter . 
Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts . 
Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes . 
( Leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac , says Ramsey . 
) 
Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern , many design facets , warmth , dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability . 
That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month . 
Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's , two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated , but warm look in contemporary . 
These two , Heritage and Drexel , chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece , but a collection of correlated designs , each of which could stand alone . 
The Heritage collection , to be shown by Sanger-Harris and Anderson's Studio , has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time . 
Called Perennian , to indicate its lasting , good today and tomorrow quality , the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces . 
Walnut , wormy chestnut , pecan , three varieties of burl , hand-woven Philippine cane , ceramic tiles , marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence , the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors , brick or paneled walls , windows that bring in the outdoors . 
It is a collection with a custom-design look , offering simplicity with warmth , variety and vitality . 
The Drexel collection , called Composite , to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating , a mature modern that is a variation of many designs . 
Rounded posts give a soft , sculptured look , paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches , table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia . 
A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving , a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end , recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest . 
An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented , with a young , basic , functional group of chests , dressers and corner units and a canted headboard . 
The other bedroom has heavier styling , door-fronted dressers with acacia panels , a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror . 
Colorful , bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics , with the magenta , pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite . 
The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles . 
Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group , Composite . 
The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony , to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top . 
See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor . 
To bring warmth to the dining area , golden orange tones are used in the fabrics . 
Dignity and comfort , in a contemporary manner , reflecting the best aspects of today's design , with substance and maturity , keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage . 
Center panel , hand-screened wood , actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases . 
Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile . 
The Vagabonds are `` on the road '' again . 
Members are on their way to Saledo , not by stage coach , but in air-conditioned cars . 
This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach Inn and adjoining country club , Saledo , for festivities . 
Invitations have been extended to some Austin dignitaries including Gov. and Mrs. Price Daniel . 
Stagecoach Days is the theme for the weekend on the Old Chisholm Trail . 
The get-together Friday night will be a banquet at the country club patio and pool , and an orchestra will play for dancing . 
Guests will wear costumes typical of the Chisholm Trail Days . 
Ginghams and calico will be popular dress for the women . 
The men will be in western attire , including Stetsons and colored vests . 
Decorating the ballroom will be the yellow rose of Texas , in tall bushes ; ; 
bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes . 
There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with eyes that flash at the guests . 
Mr. and Mrs. Phil G. Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip . 
Committee members aiding them in planning the entertainment are Messrs and Mmes Roy McKee , George McElyee , Jack Fanning , W. H. Roquemore and Joe Darrow . 
The travel club is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto `` Go Somewhere , Anywhere , Everywhere '' . 
Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go to Europe . 
In the past , the men and women have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica , buses to Mineral Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and Galveston . 
Four parties are given a year . 
Two of these are in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity . 
Serving on the club's board are Mmes R. P. Anderson , president ; ; 
A. F. Schmalzried , secretary ; ; 
W. H. Roquemore , treasurer , and the following chairmen : Mmes McKee , publicity ; ; 
Lawrence B. Jones , yearbook , and Sam Laughlin , scrapbook . 
A cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off Tuesday . 
Mrs. Alice H. Reese , wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son , was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel . 
Mrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals . 
Second grand prize of $5,000 went to Mrs. Clara L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring , a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze . 
Mother of five 
Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist . 
She lives in Wellsville , Mo. . 
Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals . 
And the third time was the charm . 
She dreamed up the cookie recipe , tried it , liked it and entered it in the contest . 
The second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist . 
The third time was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges . 
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph R. Bolker will give a dinner on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs. Norman Chandler , chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee , and Mr. Chandler . 
Mr. Bolker heads a group within the building and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural center for the performing arts . 
A feature of the party will be a presentation by Welton Becket , center architect , of color slides and renderings of the three-building complex . 
Foliage will glow at formal fall party 
Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los Angeles Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening . 
More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in the spring . 
Among those with reservations are Messrs. and Mmes. William A. Thompson , Van Cott Niven , A. B. Cox , David Bricker , Samuel Perry and Robert D. Stetson . 
Others are Drs. and Mmes. Alfred Robbins , and J. Lafe Ludwig and Gen. and Mrs. Leroy Watson . 
Guests from across U.S. honor Dr. Swim 
When Dr. W. A. Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club , guests came by chartered plane from all over the country . 
A flight originating in Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points . 
Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known Dr. Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles . 
He started practice in 1917 , and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners . 
Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-Seeberg , a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage . 
A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing . 
She put the violin away and took out some linen , needles and yarn to while away the long , idle days in Budapest . 
Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and , at 26 , she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles . 
Her days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna . 
There they continued their studies at the university , she in art , he in architecture . 
And there she had her first showing of tapestry work . 
There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America today . 
What most people don't seem to realize , if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am , is that 90% of the problem is transportation . 
I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until , at long last , both of my boys got squeezed into high school . 
It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school . 
Getting to and from school was no problem . 
They either walked or were driven . 
Now they go to a high school that is two miles away . 
One might think the problem would be similar . 
They could walk , ride on a bus or be driven . 
It's much more complex than that . 
Generally , they go to school with a girl named Gloriana , who lives down the block , and has a car . 
This is a way of getting to school , but , I understand , it entails a certain loss of social status . 
A young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is , and is also a girl . 
`` Why don't you walk to school then '' ? ? 
I suggested . 
`` My father walked , through two miles of snow , in Illinois '' . 
`` Did you '' ? ? 
I was asked . 
`` No '' , I said , `` I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois '' . 
I explained , however , that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom . 
I had to ride a streetcar two miles . 
Sometimes the streetcar was late . 
Sometimes there weren't even any seats . 
I had to stand up , with the ladies . 
Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all , but wound up at the ocean , or some other dismal place , and had to spend the day there . 
I've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then . 
When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car . 
She has to have at least one car herself . 
I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife , who is only a woman . 
Even that isn't satisfactory . 
If they have to take any car , they'd rather take the big one . 
They say that when they take a car , Gloriana doesn't take her car , but rides with them . 
But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her , so the little car isn't big enough . 
The logic of that is impeccable , of course , except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car , by my wife , when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself . 
The solution , naturally , is the bus . 
However , it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus , and it's too hard on my legs . 
My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there . 
But that's hardly realistic . 
Nobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman , and he's already got an education . 
Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register which made news last week . 
Published annually by William Hord Richardson , the 1962 edition , subtitled Society Register of Southern California , is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's postman . 
Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book `` but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers , addresses , other residences , club affiliations and marriages '' . 
Stars for marriage 
Stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year . 
Last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of Meredith Jane Cooper , daughter of the Grant B. Coopers , to Robert Knox Worrell , and of Mary Alice Ghormley to Willard Pen Tudor . 
Others are Carla Ruth Craig to Dan McFarland Chandler Jr. ; ; 
Joanne Curry , daughter of the Ellsworth Currys , to James Hartley Gregg , and Valerie Smith to James McAlister Duque . 
Also noted are the marriages of Elizabeth Browning , daughter of the George L. Brownings , to Austin C. Smith Jr. ; ; 
Cynthia Flower , daughter of the Ludlow Flowers Jr. , to Todd Huntington , son of the David Huntingtons . 
Pasadena listings 
Listed as newly wed in the Pasadena section of the new book are Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Moody Haskins 3 . 
She is the former Judy Chapman , daughter of John S. Chapman of this city . 
The young couple live in Pasadena . 
Another marriage of note is that of Jane McAlester and William Louis Pfau . 
Changes in address are noted . 
For instance , the Edwin Pauleys Jr. , formerly of Chantilly Rd. , are now at home on North Arden Dr. in Beverly Hills . 
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Moulton now live on Wilshire and the Franklin Moultons on S. Windsor Blvd. . 
The Richard Beesemyers , formerly of Connecticut , have returned to Southern California and are now residing on South Arden Blvd. . 
But the Raoul Esnards have exchanged their residence in Southern California for Mexico City . 
More new addresses 
Judge and Mrs. Julian Hazard are now at Laguna Beach , while the Frank Wangemans have moved from Beverly Hills to New York , where he is general manager of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . 
And Lawrence Chase , son of the Ransom Chases , is listed at his new address in Oxford , Eng. . 
Others listed at new addresses are the Richard T. Olerichs , the Joseph Aderholds Jr. , the Henri De La Chapelles , the John Berteros and Dr. and Mrs. Egerton Crispin , the John Armisteads , the Allen Chases , the Howard Lockies , the Thomas Lockies , and Anthony Longinotti . 
Newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the Ray Carbones , formerly of Panama ; ; 
the Geddes MacGregors , formerly of Scotland , and Mr. and Mrs. Werner H. Althaus , formerly of Switzerland . 
Here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming , using puppets for lamp bases . 
Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies , and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action , rather than put away in boxes . 
Displayed as lamps , the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent . 
To create such a lamp , order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop . 
Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket , allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head . 
Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted `` L '' , the foot of the `` L '' about three inches long , so that the puppet can hang directly under the light . 
Pulling strings 
Using the strings that manipulate the puppet , suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base . 
In this way , you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position , with feet , or one foot , barely resting on the pedestal . 
If the puppets are of uniform size , you can change them in accord with your child's whims . 
Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony , it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime . 
Those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round . 
The scalloped edge is particularly appealing . 
Today's trend toward furniture designs from America's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era . 
A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions . 
In the background lurked the feeling , however , that these pieces , beautiful as they were , lacked the utilitarian touch . 
So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy , nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the `` hard knocks '' , while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only . 
This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's , according to decorator consultant , Leland Alden . 
Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs , says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had `` an innate sense of the practical '' . 
Solid investment 
There are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century designer had to develop `` down to earth '' designs -- or go out of business . 
Hotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction , the versatile `` Kings 4 , Plus Two '' . 
This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated , fast moving outfit specializing in skits , vocals , comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch . 
Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth , Bill Kay , Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson , flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens . 
The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine , and the beat is solid . 
In the comedy division , the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props . 
Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense , part of which can be classed as pure slapstick . 
Kings 4 , have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs . 
If they can't chalk up big business here then let's stop this noise about how hip we are , and stick to our community singing , 
elsewhere 
Andy Bartha and his trio have booked into Oceania Lounge . 
The Cumbancheros , Latin combo , open Tuesday at the Four O'Clock Club . 
`` Flip '' Phillips for a return engagement at Fireside Steak Ranch Wednesday ; ; 
same date , Johnny LaSalle trio to the Jolly Roger . 
Dick Carroll and his accordion ( which we now refer to as `` Freida '' ) held over at Bahia Cabana where `` Sir '' Judson Smith brings in his calypso capers Oct. 13 . 
Johnny Leighton picked up some new numbers out in Texas which he's springing on the ringsiders in the Rum House at Galt Ocean Mile Hotel . 
`` Skip '' Hovarter back in town from a summer in the Reno-Lake Tahoe area where he ran into Rusty Warren , Kay Martin , the Marskmen and Tune Toppers -- all pulling good biz , he says . 
We like Fike 
Al Fike , an ex-schoolteacher from Colorado , is currently pursuing the three R's -- rhythm , reminiscence and repartee -- in a return class session at the Trade Winds Hotel . 
Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes for a smoother operation but it's substantially the same format heard last spring . 
Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano , Wes Robbins , bass and trumpet , and Jack Kelly on drums . 
It's a solid show but , except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie , it's Al's all the way . 
Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality , and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience . 
He skips around from jazz , to blues to boogie -- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act . 
This is a bouncy show which may get a little too frantic at times , but is nevertheless worth your appraisal . 
New owners 
Cafe Society opens formally this afternoon under its new ownership . 
George Kissak is the bossman ; ; 
Terry Barnes has been named manager . 
Spot retains the same decor although crystal chandeliers have been installed above the terrace dining area , and the kitchen has undergone a remodeling job . 
Latter domain , under the guidance of Chef Tom Yokel , will specialize in steaks , chops , chicken and prime beef as well as Tom's favorite dish , stuffed shrimp . 
Bandstand features Hal DeCicco , pianist , for both dinner hour and the late trade . 
The Tic-Tac-Toe trio is the club's new show group which also plays for dancing .

Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world ? ? 
More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church . 
At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged . 
A young real estate salesman , Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force . 
He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing . 
Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism , but never felt there was anything he , as an individual , could do about it . 
When he attended the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade school here about six months ago , Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it . 
The best approach , he figured , was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church . 
And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a Biblically strong Christianity . 
So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program . 
This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation ; ; 
a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack , another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami ; ; 
and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high school and college days , by Ted Place , director of Greater Miami Youth for Christ , and Jon Braun , director of Campus Crusade for Christ . 
The second half of the film `` Communism on the Map '' and the movie `` Operation Abolition '' also will be shown . 
Response to the program has been so encouraging , Kern said , that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon . 
And to encourage other churches to try their own programs , Kern said this Sunday's sessions -- including the free dinner -- will be open to anyone who makes reservations . 
The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week . 
Of particular meaning to the Charles MacWhorter family , 3181 SW 24th Ter. , will be the Family Dedication Service planned for 10:50 a.m. Sunday at First Christian Church . 
It will be the second time the assistant manager of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies . 
The first one , two years ago , changed the routine of their home life . 
`` When you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith , you strive a little harder to uphold those vows '' , explains the slender vice president of the young couples Sunday school class . 
Until that first dedication service , he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home . 
They have five daughters -- Coral Lee , 5 , Glenda Rae , 4 , Pamela , 3 , Karen , 2 , and Shari , five months . 
But after that service , they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table , have bedtime prayers , and Bible stories . 
To their surprise , the children all were eager and quite able to take part . 
Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her . 
Dade's chief probation officer , Jack Blanton , will lead a discussion on `` The Changes in the American Family '' at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Christ Lutheran Church . 
Mr. and Mrs. George Treadwell will be honored at a Family Week supper and program at 6 p.m. Sunday at Trinity Methodist Church . 
He is the sexton of the church . 
A family worship service will follow the program at 7:45 p.m. . 
The outstanding family of Central Nazarene Church will be picked by ballot from among eight families during the 10:45 a.m. Sunday service marking National Family Week . 
Every family of Riviera Presbyterian Church has been asked to read the Bible and pray together daily during National Christian Family Week and to undertake one project in which all members of the family participate . 
To start the week of special programs at the church , the Rev. John D. Henderson will preach on `` A Successful Marriage '' at 9:40 and 11 a.m. Sunday . 
New officers of the church will be ordained and installed at the 7:30 p.m. service . 
A father and son dinner sponsored by the Men's Club will be held at 6:15 p.m. Monday and the annual church picnic at 4 p.m. next Saturday . 
The week will end with the Rev. Mr. Henderson preaching on `` The Marriage Altar '' at 7:30 p.m. Sunday , May 14 . 
The resignation of the Rev. Warren I. Densmore , headmaster of St. Stephen's Episcopal Day School in Coconut Grove , becomes effective July 15 . 
Enrique Jorda , conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony , will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season , it was announced . 
The guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18 , with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne . 
The season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22 . 
During his five-month visit abroad , Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France , and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome . 
In announcing Jorda's return , the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday . 
Guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra , including violinists Yehudi Menuhin , Isaac Stern , Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; ; 
pianists Leon Fleisher , Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray . 
The Leningrad Kirov Ballet , which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House , is , I think , the finest `` classical '' ballet company I have ever seen , and the production of the Petipa-Tschaikowsky `` Sleeping Beauty '' with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing . 
This work is no favorite of mine . 
I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar , infantile , and reactionary aspect ; ; 
that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; ; 
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ; ; 
that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms . 
All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation . 
Precise 
The reasons for this enchantment are numerous , but most of them end in `` ova '' , `` eva '' , or `` aya '' . 
In other words , no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet . 
It seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- Miss Omsk , Miss Pinsk , Miss Stalingr oops , skip it . 
These qualities alone , however , would not account for their success , and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality . 
It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet . 
Oh-the-pain-of-it , that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety , is totally absent from the Kirov . 
This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics . 
But , obviously , at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned . 
Irina Kolpakova , the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance , would be a change for the better anywhere , at any time , no matter who had had the role before . 
She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on , and her dancing has a feminine suavity , lightness , sparkle , and refinement which are simply incomparable . 
Hit 
Alla Sizova , who seems to have made a special hit in the East , was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner , Yuri Soloviev , was wonderfully virile , acrobatic , and poetic all at the same time , in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky . 
Vladilen Semenov , a fine `` danseur noble '' ; ; 
Konstantin Shatilov , a great character dancer ; ; 
and Inna Zubkovskaya , an excellent Lilac Fairy , were other outstanding members of the cast , but every member of the cast was magnificent . 
The production , designed by Simon Virsaladze , was completely traditional but traditional in the right way . 
It was done with great taste , was big and spacious , sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes , but sumptuous in a muted , pastel-like style , with rich , quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery . 
Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra , one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster , Guy Lumia , were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity . 
Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society . 
The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p.m. with a concert by the Mills Chamber Players . 
Sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season ; ; 
annual members may attend for $16 . 
Participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle ) . 
Mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2 , may be addressed to the society , 1044 Chestnut Street , San Francisco 9 . 
San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children . 
Fire Fighters Local 798 , which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year , issued a call for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys , which will be repaired by off-duty firemen . 
Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year . 
They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association , at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown mall , and at the Junior Museum , 16th Street and Roosevelt Way . 
From the collection centers , toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street , where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution . 
Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys , 676 Howard street , San Francisco 5 , and listing the parent's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12 . 
Requests must be mailed in by December 5 . 
Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his instrument to the East Room of the White House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal . 
He was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin . 
President Kennedy's invitation to the Spanish-born master said , `` We feel your performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our guests '' . 
For A good many seasons I've been looking at the naughty stuff on television , so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies . 
After all , this year's movies are next year's television shows . 
So I went to see `` La Dolce Vita '' . 
It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality . 
All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film . 
If that's all the Romans did , it's a surprise to me that Rome fell . 
After television , `` La Dolce Vita '' seems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night . 
I cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on TV every week . 
I believe TV watchers will be bored . 
`` La Dolce Vita '' has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average TV Western . 
Week in , week out , there is more sex to be seen in `` The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet '' . 
There is more decadence on `` 77 Sunset Strip '' . 
There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series . 
In another respect , television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns . 
With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg , the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge Theater . 
Most of the emphasis has been placed on a `` wild party '' at a seaside villa . 
Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ! ! 
The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; ; 
a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; ; 
a frigid beauty , and three silly fairies . 
Put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of : dull . 
Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall . 
What a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ! ! 
As A moral shocker it is a dud . 
But this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting , if not great , film . 
The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly : 
`` This is a long picture and a controversial one , but basically it is a moral , enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political , cultural and religious glories '' . 
And when they sell it to television in a couple of years , it can be shown without editing .

And you think you have language problems . 
The week went along briskly enough . 
I bought a new little foreign bomb . 
It is a British bomb . 
Very austere yet racy . 
It is very chic to drive foreign cars . 
With a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back . 
You must also wear a car coat . 
The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive . 
But we couldn't really get along without it . 
`` Where do you put the lighter fluid , ha , ha '' ? ? 
Asked the gas station man . 
The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor . 
Gas station people are very debonair about small cars . 
When I drove a car with tail fins , I had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases . 
My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth . 
This excellent foreign bomb takes only six . 
When I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome , the gas people were happy to see me . 
`` Tires OK ? ? 
Check the oil and water , sir ? ? 
'' 
They polished the windshield . 
They had a loving touch . 
The man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank . 
`` What kind of car is it '' ? ? 
He asked gloomily . 
`` It is a British Austin , the smallest they make '' . 
`` Get much mileage '' ? ? 
`` About 35 '' . 
The gas station man sighed unhappily . 
`` What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that ? ? 
Crunch , that's all she wrote '' . 
`` I will die rich '' . 
`` That will be $1.80 '' , said the gas station man . 
`` The windshield looks pretty clean '' . 
Ah , the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ! ! 
When I wheeled about , finned fore and aft , I was the darling of the doormen . 
Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely . 
With a small bomb , I tuck it between Cadillacs . 
( The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself . 
High blood pressure can get the best of any of us . 
) 
At last the White House is going to get some much-copied furniture by that master American craftsman , Duncan Phyfe , whose designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U. S. Presidents of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings . 
The American Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of sofas and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library . 
The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's . 
The gift is being presented by `` heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey , whose famous estate , `` Tranquility '' , was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover , N. J. . 
Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon , although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago . 
This acquisition is a matched , perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long , plus six sidechairs and two armchairs . 
The AID has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home . 
It is the AID's intention to create in the library `` a miniature museum of Americana '' before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall . 
The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture . 
The AID has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel McIntyre of Salem , Mass. , an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792 . 
The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace . 
It will be painted to match the paneling in the room . 
The AID committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration , Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon , was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the project . 
Mrs. Lenygon's committee associates , announced formally yesterday by the AID in New York , include Mrs. Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J. Jussel , both wellknown Manhattan decorators . 
Regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include Frank E. Barnes of Boston . 
President Kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard , N. C. . 
But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music . 
At 4 p.m. the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians , students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp , and to greet the 325 crippled , cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert . 
It was the first in the series of `` Concerts for Young People by Young People '' to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House . 
She was not present yesterday , however , to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience . 
She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port , Mass. , and in his welcoming remarks , the President said he was representing her . 
As he approached the open bandstand , erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion , the band struck up the `` Star Spangled Banner '' and followed it with `` Hail To The Chief '' . 
`` I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band , and we are grateful to them '' , President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl . 
After paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students , President Kennedy said , `` As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music '' . 
He added `` I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field '' . 
Displaying his knowledge of music , the New England-born President remarked that `` probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont , by young Americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers , and their work is being duplicated all across the United States . 
`` This is a great national cultural asset , and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me , representing as I do today my wife , to welcome all of you here today at the White House '' . 
As he left the bandstand to return to his office , the slender , sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests . 
He expressed surprise to learn that pretty , blonde Patricia Holbrook , 16 , of Mount Rainier , had attended the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston . 
`` The nuns there do a wonderful work '' , the President commented . 
Patricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe Health School in the District . 
Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red , white and blue ribbon . 
They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staff . 
Many of the music-loving members of the President's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience . 
And it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected . 
Henry Hall Wilson , a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives , turned guest conductor for a Sousa march , the `` Stars and Stripes Forever '' . 
Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary , Letitia Baldrige , told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring . 
He said he contacted a friend , Henry Hall Wilson , on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play , in the series . 
A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert . 
One of the most interested `` students '' on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House , was Letitia Baldrige , social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy . 
`` I was an art major in college '' , Miss Baldrige explained . 
`` I've been here so many times I couldn't count them '' . 
She turned out to be a fan , too , of Margaret Bouton , the Gallery's associate curator of education . 
Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p.m. . 
The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p.m. , remaining for about 45 minutes . 
The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later . 
They decided that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look `` sad '' ; ; 
they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's `` Alba Madonna '' and `` texture '' in a Monet painting of Rheims Cathedral . 
Everybody had heard of Van Gogh , the French impressionist . 
Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group , standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them . 
He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery `` is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director , Richard Bales . 
I'm sure you've heard of him and his record , ' The Confederacy ' '' . 
Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group , went one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards . 
In 45 minutes , the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century . 
A few of them said they `` preferred contemporary art '' . 
Among the other artists , whose paintings were discussed were Boucher , Courbet , Fra Angelico . 
The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain `` because it's on the second floor '' . 
That imposing , somewhat austere , and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St. nw. took on bustling life yesterday . 
More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader , Albert Pike , who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891 . 
They came together in the huge , high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized . 
C. Wheeler Barnes of Denver , head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado , praised Pike as a historian , author , poet , journalist , lawyer , jurist , soldier and musician , who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order . 
The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple . 
A reception and tea followed . 
About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States . 
The opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. today . 
There will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2:30 p.m. . 
A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George Washington , one of this Nation's first Masons -- a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria . 
The marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years . 
John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous . 
He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children , or spend much time chatting with his wife . 
Hurt by his lack of interest and attention , Mary complained often that he didn't help around the house , and that he didn't really care about the family . 
She accused him of ignoring her . 
He in turn told her she demanded too much . 
They were both discouraged , disgusted and miserable . 
Mary decided she had had enough . 
Without any definite plan in mind , she went to a judge to see what could be done . 
The judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyer . 
Family Service , sharing in UGF , has five agencies in the Washington area . 
They offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems . 
Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up , Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia , the agency nearest them . 
For nearly a year , they have been receiving counseling , separately and together , in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce . 
The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other . 
They are now working together toward solving their difficulties . 
John received a promotion in his firm . 
He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life . 
Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings , and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy , family rough-housing . 
To outsiders , the Blacks seem to be an ordinary , happy family , and they are -- but with a difference . 
They know the value of being just that -- an ordinary , happy family . 
Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this area . 
Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital . 
But to the families it serves , their help cannot be measured . 
Family Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers Fund . 
Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday , park rangers said , and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze . 
For crucial encounter 
One of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev . 
Mr. Kennedy replied : 
`` I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground '' . 
The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable . 
But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military , economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting . 
He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy . 
Last Friday the White House announced : 
President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4 . 
The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-West relations . 
The heightened tension , in fact , had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader . 
He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned . 
But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe . 
That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting . 
Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting , it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war . 
Road to Vienna 
The U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace `` at the summit of the nations '' . 
The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the `` spirit of Geneva '' . 
The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East . 
In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S. . 
That meeting produced the `` spirit of Camp David '' -- a spirit , it later turned out , that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement . 
On the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory `` spirit '' . 
Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the U-2 incident . 
The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda , the hope of one-sided concessions , and the chance to split the Allies , rather than genuine negotiation , were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry . 
Pre-inaugural position 
Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President , Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem . 
Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words : 
`` As long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way , no amount of either smiles or toughness , neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates , can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations '' . 
The President had set for himself the task , which he believed vital , of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance . 
He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary . 
He wanted time , too , to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating . 
Above all , he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep . 
Attitude flexible 
At the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader . 
Ideally , he knew , it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels . 
But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting , provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it . 
It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war , to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views . 
Moreover , an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions . 
Both elements -- the caution about a meeting , the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February . 
The letter , dated Feb. 22 , was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk , Siberia , on March 9 . 
It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-West issues . 
But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted . 
Developments over the next two months , however , caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing . 
There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting , not because the international climate was improving , but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly . 
Deadlock on tests 
The President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva . 
The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East , West and neutral ) directorate , and thus a veto , over the control machinery . 
In the U. S. , strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing . 
Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown , or even continued stalemate , would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament . 
There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons , particularly to Communist China . 
The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent . 
Moreover , Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies , including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos . 
Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements , or even negotiations , impossible . 
Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting . 
Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting . 
At the same time , there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader , as a result of those episodes , come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure . 
In Cuba , the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep . 
In Laos , the picture was almost equally bad . 
U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be `` neutralized '' on Soviet terms . 
Beyond that , Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces . 
As a result , the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos , and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure . 
In the light of those events , there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself . 
Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive . 
He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out . 
The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin , Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back . 
It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future . 
Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies . 
The response from London , Paris and Bonn was favorable . 
Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week . 
Apparently at the insistence of the U. S. , the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the `` informal '' nature of the meeting . 
The Washington announcement said : 
`` The President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries . 
The meeting will , however , afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries '' . 
The outlook 
The Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned , 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who , in Mr. Kennedy's own words , is `` shrewd , tough , vigorous , well-informed and confident '' , and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy . 
The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval . 
The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna . 
The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations . 
But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary . 
Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men . 
The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause . 
Apart from the personal equation , another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.S. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit . 
Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway . 
This time the initiative came , in part at least , from Washington . 
Other allies consulted 
There was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev , the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders . 
Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity . 
Finally , there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord . 
There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world . 
If tests are to be resumed , the argument went , it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union . 
Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse . 
After Cuba and Laos , it was argued , Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds . 
Moreover , the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments . 
The question was raised , for example , as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East . 
There are , so my biologist friends tell me , mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory . 
Mollusks are a case in point . 
The shell , which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme , tended to cancel out the possibility of future development . 
Though this may or may not be good biology , it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education . 
There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities . 
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades , rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that . 
By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence . 
There is , however , one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture . 
Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect , we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university . 
But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; ; 
certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy . 
Official encouragement is one thing , but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds . 
American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning . 
They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made . 
Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility . 
All of this may be understandable enough : it is , however , in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise . 
Yet for better or for worse , the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative , resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities . 
Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible . 
To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education , it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community . 
It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment . 
A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere . 
The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension . 
The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship , the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship . 
American Catholic colleges and universities are , in a very real sense , the product of `` private enterprise '' -- the `` private enterprise '' of religious communities . 
Had it not been for such private enterprise , diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees . 
There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the `` family business '' . 
This `` family-community '' spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement . 
It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education , in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas . 
I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments , clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university , which is also co-educational . 
This is not an isolated example ; ; 
this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough . 
It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot . 
Apart , however , from the question of wasteful duplication , there is another aspect of the `` family business '' spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny . 
For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions , which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools , it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its `` pursuit of excellence '' . 
At the earlier `` pre-academic excellence '' stage of Catholic education , the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis . 
But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training , the need for `` outsiders '' becomes more pressing . 
The problem is not merely that more `` outside teachers '' are needed but that a different brand is called for . 
Commenting on the earlier stage , the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term `` teacher-employee '' ( as opposed to , e.g. , `` maintenance employee '' ) was a not inapt description . 
Today however , the `` outsider '' is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university . 
And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene , the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement . 
In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors , the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : `` Even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which , considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms , is inhomogeneous , mortal and of extremely varying temperament , interests and capabilities . 
It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are , in their opinion , identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) ' the attainment of excellence ' '' . 
The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by `` the organization which actually owns '' it , becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished `` outside '' faculty . 
It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to `` the organization which actually owns the university '' : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension . 
But in any case , one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one . 
`` Outside '' faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business . 
There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university . 
In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel . 
Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession , much given to attending meetings and conferences . 
Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype . 
In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere . 
To appreciate the nature of the gamble , it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security , that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service . 
Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure . 
This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated . 
When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion , not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services . 
A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the `` family '' . 
Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices , it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions . 
Adequate compensation is indispensable . 
Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place . 
Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university . 
Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification . 
There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that , at the college level , the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels . 
The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication , even informal debates over the luncheon table , are a contribution to the total good of the institution . 
But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation . 
The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the `` in-group '' that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees , is , therefore , the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself . 
This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure . 
Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control , there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order . 
The first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority . 
In the case of academic personnel the `` feeling '' of participation can hardly be `` faked '' . 
Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions . 
Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by `` busy-work '' and ersatz decision making . 
In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all . 
In the Notre Dame report , reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to `` luncheon-table communication '' . 
In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of `` participation '' : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy , i.e. , members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution , have their own eating arrangements . 
Sen. John L. McClellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws . 
Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws , there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally . 
Or , in the words of Anatole France , `` The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich , as well as the poor , from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges '' . 
The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. McClellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and , later , into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites . 
The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program . 
In addition , disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill . 
It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages , but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike . 
Business Week ( Aug. 9 , 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company , against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike , decided to keep its plants operating . 
The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees , hiring and training them , extra overtime , and defective work performed by the new workers . 
The company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business . 
Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee . 
The committee remains unresponsive . 
Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan been heard from on the matter ; ; 
they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions . 
The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained . 
The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete , but along completely undefined lines ; ; 
it must play a game in which there never is a winner . 
The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law . 
Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy . 
Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric , Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market . 
The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied . 
The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment . 
Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price . 
Naturally , enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time . 
Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles , they would become the only survivors in the industry . 
Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by `` unfair competition '' . 
But if they show self-restraint , they don't get the orders . 
Under the circumstances , the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted . 
Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants . 
The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government , after the conviction , that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows . 
In other words , the anti-trust laws , designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday , Wednesday and Friday , become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday . 
And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday ? ? 
The question might be asked : `` Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts ? ? 
Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas , throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter , expressing their complete confidence in the laws '' ? ? 
The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold , in The Folklore of Capitalism , back in 1937 . 
He wrote : `` ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations , and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure . 
( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship . 
( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked , it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control . 
In this manner , every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws . 
( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event , it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known , held together by some of the most fantastic ideas , all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government '' . 
This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while . 
A plea of nolo contendere , followed by a nominal fine , after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license . 
( The penalties handed out in the electrical case , which included jail sentences , were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions , perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities . 
) 
If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market , quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest . 
A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle . 
However , one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational . 
Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union . 
Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform . 
Before 1933 , individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English . 
The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934 , implicit in the writing of Section 7A of the National Industrial Recovery Act , has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle . 
The Wagner Act , the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining . 
The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition . 
If a union cannot perform this function , then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud . 
The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession . 
The problem must be faced squarely . 
If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported , by the way , by any agricultural subsidy ) , then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them . 
Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America . 
As early as 1776 , Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : `` We have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; ; 
but many against combining to raise it '' . 
Eighteenth-century England , upon whose customs our common law was built , had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies . 
In 1825 , the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers , who declared : `` It is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies '' . 
There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining , but against labor monopoly . 
The courts shared the opinion of the employers . 
In People vs. Fisher , Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared : 
`` Without any officious and improper interference on the subject , the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; ; 
but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means '' . 
Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin , according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19 , 1961 , defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor `` if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages , production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages , hours and conditions of employment '' . 
Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation . 
His bill , allegedly aimed at Hoffa , would amend the Sherman , Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international . 
Paradoxically , the same week in which Senator McClellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation , the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel , the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act . 
Indeed , it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; ; 
for example , the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers . 
At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation , a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates . 
The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies . 
It was most effective against trade unions . 
In the famous Danbury Hatters case , a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices , e.g. , trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer . 
The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment . 
In 1914 , the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity . 
The law could not suspend economics . 
Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws . 
The courts , by interpretation , emasculated the act . 
In 1922 , the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company . 
The company sued under the anti-trust laws , alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce . 
( What other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise ? ? 
) The court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce . 
The nation 
the three-front war 
At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . 
Afterward , Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . 
What Herter presented , said Gore , was `` not a very encouraging review '' . 
That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . 
While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . 
1 ) Cuba . 
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery , Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . 
President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers , decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately . 
`` There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure '' , said the President . 
`` That limit has now been reached '' . 
Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision . 
Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declined . 
He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere ) . 
2 ) Laos . 
After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam . 
`` In view of the present situation in Laos '' , said the Pentagon's announcement , `` we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific '' . 
Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong , the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines . 
On the U.S.'s island base of Okinawa , Task Force 116 , made up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air Force units , got braced to move southward on signal . 
But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ) , and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-Western -- government might be best for Laos . 
French & Indians . 
There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts . 
Political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right . 
`` It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again '' , said one military man . 
But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground ? ? 
At Geneva in 1954 , to get the war in Indo-China settled , the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state , North Viet Nam -- which then , predictably , became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos . 
The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement , saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West . 
He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of Aj . 
`` The important thing from now on '' , he said , `` is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia '' . 
Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana , Russian intrigue in the Congo , and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time . 
Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy , and got a cool acknowledgment in reply . 
Considering the state of the whole world , the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; ; 
but , in Senator Gore's words , it was `` not a very encouraging '' situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day . 
The Congress 
turmoil in the House 
As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week , liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor . 
The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before , and had always lost . 
This time , they were much better prepared and organized , and the political climate was favorable . 
They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy , whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck . 
And counting noses , they seemed to have the votes to work their will . 
Deadly deadlock . 
There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock , or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ) . 
Caucusing , the liberals decided to go after Colmer , which actually was the more drastic course , since seniority in the House is next to godliness . 
A dour , gangling man with a choppy gait , Colmer looks younger than his 70 years , has gradually swung from a moderate , internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative . 
He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project , unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents . 
He is , of course , a segregationist , but he says he has never made an `` anti-Negro '' speech . 
For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee . 
There his vote , along with those of Chairman Howard Smith , the courtly Virginia judge , and the four Republican members , could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out , Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ) . 
Equal treatment . 
There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi . 
Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations , but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons . 
In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman , and in 1957 , after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 , his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments , although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage . 
( In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week , Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell . 
Said he : `` We will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here '' . 
) But Speaker Sam Rayburn , after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy , decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective . 
In a tense , closed-door session with Judge Smith , Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats , including one Southerner , and one Republican ) . 
Smith flatly rejected the offer , and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels . 
The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer , whom he is said to regard as `` an inferior man '' . 
News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out . 
When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word , he turned purple . 
`` Unconscionable '' ! ! 
He shouted , and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object : `` A dangerous precedent '' ! ! 
Cannon , a powerful , conservative man , brought welcome support to the Smith-Colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects . 
Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally , Georgia's Carl Vinson , chairman of the Armed Services Committee . 
Threat of war . 
As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses , it became clear that Judge Smith could lose . 
His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus . 
The liberals , smelling blood , were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees , in the full party caucus , and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer . 
( One big question : If Colmer was to be purged , what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors ? ? 
) In all three arenas , they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash . 
But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war . 
If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused , they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships , leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated , unworkable party . 
With that possibility in mind , Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees , and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise . 
`` Here are two old men , mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone '' , said a House Democratic leader . 
`` One wants a little more power , and the other doesn't want to give up any '' . 
Battle in the senate 
The Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle , but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech . 
Question at issue : How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters ? ? 
A wide-ranging , bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats , who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills . 
New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate , instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds . 
Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante , asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators . 
Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely , and the battle was joined . 
Privately , the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage . 
Privately , they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon . 
In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress , and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding . 
Armed with the Nixon opinion , the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week . 
Hopefully , the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all . 
Republicans 
last act 
Since Election Day , Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view . 
But with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration . 
One day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote , and then to make `` sufficient declaration '' of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election . 
Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required `` sufficient declaration '' . 
`` This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated '' , he said . 
The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves . 
Gary Player , the small , trim South African , was the eventual winner , but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap . 
Arnold Palmer , the defending champion , lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief . 
`` Just when you think you have it licked , this golf course can get up and bite you '' , Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament . 
And that is just what happened on the last few holes . 
The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer . 
Player was the first to feel its teeth . 
After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ) , Player's game rapidly fell to pieces . 
He bogeyed the 10th . 
After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th . 
He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280 . 
As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course , Player was almost in tears . 
He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer , by then playing the 15th hole , was leading him by a stroke . 
Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player , and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes . 
Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf . 
When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole , he seemed to have the championship won . 
But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression . 
In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green , past spectators and down the slope toward a TV tower . 
Afterwards , Palmer told Charlie Coe , his last-round partner , that he simply played the hole too fast . 
He did seem hasty on his second and third shots , but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out , giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure , which he had quite visibly lost . 
When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot , he overshot the hole by 15 feet . 
Palmer was now putting merely for a tie , and Player , who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment , stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt . 
Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro , but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe . 
The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur , who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years , refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69 . 
End at seven 
Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place . 
As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73 , this remarkable record was still intact , thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69 . 
His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score , a 213 by Bill Collins , the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long . 
But Palmer knew , as did everybody else at Augusta , that his streak was about to be broken . 
Half an hour after he finished his round , Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206 , four strokes ahead of Palmer . 
More than a streak had ended . 
Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes , the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player . 
Unlike most such sports rivalries , it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously , although this was not exactly the case . 
When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige . 
As if to confirm his stature , he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments . 
Player won only one . 
But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago , Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars , and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere . 
On the final round at Pensacola , the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and , although it was far from obvious at the time , the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come . 
On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and , as it turned out , neither won it . 
But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour . 
Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer . 
He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71 . 
Thereafter , until the Masters , Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami . 
When they reached Augusta last week , together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date . 
Instant rivalry 
On Thursday , the first day of the Masters , the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly . 
It was a dismal , drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course . 
The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft , so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences . 
Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead , which he shared with Bob Rosburg . 
But Player was only one stroke back , with a 69 . 
Even so , it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be , essentially , a match between Palmer and Player . 
A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus , the spectacular young amateur , who had a 70 ; ; 
or Ken Venturi , who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; ; 
or Rosburg , whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; ; 
or even old Byron Nelson , whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf . 
( On Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe . 
) 
On Friday , a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly , the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus . 
Rosburg had started early in the day , and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated , as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend , by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg , who ended with a 73 , was not having a good day . 
As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman , his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender . 
Player began with a birdie on the first hole , added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th . 
On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament . 
He birdied the 13th , the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies , one bogey and 12 pars for a 68 . 
Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle , Palmer birdied the 2nd , the 9th , the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies , one bogey and 13 pars for a 69 . 
The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta , only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph . 
At one point late in the day , when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th , a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole . 
Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer , and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply . 
The boldness of champions 
Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course . 
It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence . 
The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions . 
Bob Jones played that way . 
Byron Nelson did , Hogan did . 
And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did . 
As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest , it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead . 
This day Palmer had started first . 
As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day . 
Player immediately proceeded to follow suit . 
In fact , he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well , to go 4 under par for the first eight holes . 
But Player's real test came on the ninth hole , a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards . 
He hit a poor tee shot , pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways . 
Having hit one of the trees , the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out . 
Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5 , or gambling . 
The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse , hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green . 
`` I was hitting the ball well '' , Player said later , `` and I felt strong . 
When you're playing like that you'd better attack '' . 
Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget . 
It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge . 
From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4 . 
Palmer , meanwhile , had been having his troubles . 
They started on the 4th hole , a 220-yard par-3 . 
On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast , and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days . 
At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club , so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green . 
His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par . 
Starting the second nine , Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it . 
When Mickey Charles Mantle , the New York Yankees' man of muscle , drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers , his feat touches upon the sublime . 
When Roger Eugene Maris , Mantle's muscular teammate , powers four home runs in a double-header , his performance merits awe . 
But when tiny , 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels , who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because , as a teammate explained , `` the other team thought no one was out there '' , hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958 , 1959 , and 1960 ) , his achievement borders on the ridiculous . 
This is Baseball 1961 . 
This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous . 
It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and , in unprecedented style , delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ; 
( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ; 
( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; ; 
and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat , two of them as a pinch-hitter . 
Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats , the shrinking strike zone , and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal . 
Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion . 
Whatever the reasons , not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records , home-run division . 
Of all the records in peril , one stands apart , dramatic in its making , dramatic in its endurance , and now , doubly dramatic in its jeopardy . 
This , of course , is baseball's most remarkable mark : The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure , the incredible athlete , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees . 
Since 1927 , fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each , in turn , has been thwarted . 
What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge . 
In the final month of the 1927 season , he hit seventeen home runs , a closing spurt never matched . 
Double threat : 
Always , in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record , one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid . 
But now , for the first time since Lou Gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927 , two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60 . 
Their names are Mantle and Maris , their team is the Yankees , and their threat is real . 
After 108 games in 1927 , Ruth had 35 home runs . 
After 108 games in 1961 , Mickey Mantle has 43 , Roger Maris 41 . 
Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games , and , mathematically , each will hit more than 60 home runs . 
This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them . 
To better Ruth's mark , neither needs a spectacular September flourish . 
All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September , and he will establish a new record . 
In Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games . 
Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games . 
) 
`` Even on the basis of 154 games , this is the ideal situation '' , insists Hank Greenberg , now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox . 
`` It has to be easier with two of them . 
How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle '' ? ? 
Roommates : 
Neither Mantle nor Maris , understandably , will predict 60 home runs for himself . 
Although both concede they would like to hit 60 , they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : `` The important thing is to win the pennant '' . 
But one thing is for certain : There is no dissension between Mantle , the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957 , and Maris , the MVP in 1960 . 
Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( `` I hope Roger hits 80 '' , Mantle says ) , and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( `` and I hope I hit 81 '' ) . 
The sluggers get along so well in fact , that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas , Maris's in Kansas City ) , they are rooming together . 
Mantle , Maris , and Bob Cerv , a utility outfielder , share an apartment in Jamaica , Long Island , not far from New York International Airport . 
The three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen , dining room , living room , and bedroom ) , with air-conditioning and new modern furniture . 
Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; ; 
Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room . 
They divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks , with dinner out ) , Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ) , and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium . 
Mantle , Maris , and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : Among them , they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv , four for Mantle , and three for Maris . 
As roommates , teammates , and home-run mates , Mantle , 29 , who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago , and Maris , 26 , who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago , have strikingly similar backgrounds . 
Both were scholastic stars in football , basketball , and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce , Okla. , Maris in Fargo , N.D. ) ; ; 
as halfbacks , both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( `` Sometimes in the minors '' , Maris recalls , `` I wished I had gone to Oklahoma '' ) . 
To an extent , the two even look alike . 
Both have blue eyes and short blond hair . 
Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds , but Mantle , incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ) , looks bigger . 
With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders , both must have their clothes made to order . 
Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York . 
Mantle , more concerned with dress , buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each . 
Light reading : 
Neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual , but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus , Henry Miller's `` Tropic of Cancer '' . 
Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips . 
Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or , for that matter , to private speaking . 
`` What do you and Mickey talk about at home '' ? ? 
A reporter asked Maris recently . 
`` To tell you the truth '' , Maris said , `` Mickey don't talk much '' . 
This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer . 
What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris , under constant pressure from writers and photographers , are trying to be cooperative . 
Of the two , Mantle is by nature the less outgoing , Maris the more outspoken . 
But last week , when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker , Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote . 
`` See that kid '' ? ? 
He said , pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy . 
`` That's ( Yogi ) Berra's . 
I'll never forget one time I struck out three times , dropped a fly ball , and we lost the game . 
I came back , sitting by my locker , feeling real low , and the kid walks over to me , looks up , and says : ' You stunk ' '' . 
Maris , in talking to reporters , tries to answer all questions candidly and fully , but on rare occasions , he shuns newsmen . 
`` When I've made a dumb play '' , he says , `` I don't want to talk to anyone . 
I'm angry '' . 
By his own confession , Maris is an angry young man . 
Benched at Tulsa in 1955 , he told manager Dutch Meyer : `` I can't play for you . 
Send me where I can play '' . 
( Meyer sent him to Reading , Pa. . 
) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956 , he told manager Kerby Farrell : `` I'm not learning anything on the bench . 
Play me '' . 
( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series . 
) `` That's the way I am '' , he says . 
`` I tell people what I think . 
If you're a good ballplayer , you've got to get mad . 
Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times '' . 
Idols' idols : 
One good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes . 
Maris's was Ted Williams . 
`` When I was a kid '' , Maris told a sportswriter last week , `` I used to follow Williams every day in the box score , just to see whether he got a hit or not '' . 
`` When you came up to the majors , did you seek out Williams for advice '' ? ? 
`` Are you kidding '' ? ? 
Said Maris . 
`` You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize '' . 
Mantle's hero was Joe DiMaggio . 
`` When Mickey went to the Yankees '' , says Mark Freeman , an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver , `` DiMaggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker , just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man , this hero of his . 
But DiMaggio never said a word . 
It crushed Mickey . 
He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star , this never would be said of him '' . 
Mantle has kept the vow . 
Among all the Yankees , he is the veteran most friendly to rookies . 
Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else . 
If laying ties on a railroad track , which he once did for $1 an hour , paid more than playing right field for the Yankees , Maris would lay ties on a railroad track . 
If working in a zinc mine , which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour , paid more than playing center field for the Yankees , Mantle would work in a zinc mine . 
But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts , Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball . 
They try to play baseball the best they can . 
Each is a complete ballplayer . 
Mantle , beyond any question , can do more things well . 
( `` One of the reasons they get along fine '' , says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men , `` is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris '' . 
) Hitting , Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed , Maris only left-handed . 
They both possess near classic stances , dug in firmly , arms high , set for fierce swings . 
Mantle is considerably better hitting for average ( 
, fourth in the league , to 
for Maris so far this year ) . 
Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; ; 
Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base . 
Both have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds , faster than any other major leaguer ; ; 
Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio , the swift , base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox . 
Both are good , daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; ; 
Maris's throwing arm is stronger . 
Yet with all their skills , the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : The home run . 
With this ultimate weapon , the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season . 
( American League expansion created , inevitably , weaker teams . 
Only two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit , the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first place . 
Appropriately , the emphasis on the home run , at a peak this year , came into being at baseball's lowest moment . 
In 1920 , as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out , fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball . 
Something was needed to revive interest ; ; 
the something was the home run . 
Into Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy's Convair , the Caroline , winged Actor-Crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal , Cinemactor Peter Lawford , Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law . 
Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater , Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard Armory . 
Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas , as he had hinted upon his arrival : `` It's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia . 
I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans '' ! ! 
As the plans were laid , some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10,000 each . 
The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper , who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles . 
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered `` two of everything '' just `` in case he spills anything '' , Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing . 
A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps , General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a `` happy , warless New Year '' greeting to his Pentagon staff . 
Said Leatherneck Shoup : `` A year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands . 
After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard , I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on . 
Little geeing and hawing have been necessary '' . 
But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots . 
Speaking of `` pride '' , he deplored the noncommissioned officer `` whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940 ; ; 
the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window . 
A few of these people are still around '' . 
Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.S. Senate , then went their respective ways . 
At a reception for new members of Congress , Oregon Democrat Maurine Neuberger , taking the Senate seat held by her husband Richard until his death last March , got a brotherly buss from Democratic Elder Statesman Adlai Stevenson , U.S. Ambassador-designate to the U.N. . 
Meanwhile , after 24 years in the Senate , Rhode Island's durable Democrat Theodore Francis Greene -- having walked , swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily , because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November ) , as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate . 
The most famous undergraduate of South Philadelphia High School is a current bobby-sox idol , Dreamboat Cacophonist Fabian ( real name : Fabian Forte ) , 17 , and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while . 
The principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia -- Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics . 
Lacking his needed credits in those subjects , Fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week . 
South Philadelphia High's principal added that the current delay was caused by the `` pressure '' of a movie that the toneless lad was making . 
To Decathlon Man Rafer Johnson ( Time cover , Aug. 29 ) , whose gold medal in last summer's Olympic Games was won as much on gumption as talent , went the A.A.U.'s James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy as the outstanding U.S. amateur athlete of 1960 . 
As the world's top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- Sports Illustrated tapped golf's confident Arnold Palmer ( Time cover , May 2 ) , who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the Masters and U.S. Open crowns , went on to win a record $80,738 for the year . 
Tooling through Sydney on his way to race in the New Zealand Grand Prix , Britain's balding Ace Driver Stirling Moss , 31 , all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination . 
`` I'm a slob '' , he announced . 
`` My taste is gaudy . 
I'm useless for anything but racing cars . 
I'm ruddy lazy , and I'm getting on in years . 
It gets so frustrating , but then again I don't know what I could do if I gave up racing '' . 
Has Moss no stirling virtues ? ? 
`` I appreciate beauty '' . 
One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers , the U.S.S.R.'s daily Izvestia , enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa , where he has been in self-exile since 1952 . 
Chaplin , 71 , who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England in 1956 , confided that he hopes to visit Russia some time this summer because `` I have marveled at your grandiose experiment and I believe in your future '' . 
Then Charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed : `` I was captivated by his humor , frankness and good nature and by his kind , strong and somewhat sly face '' . 
G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels , but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh . 
There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth , a reputation for eccentricity , and an ardor for collecting art . 
Last week , in the German city of Dusseldorf , G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause . 
On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale . 
Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time , Jan. 2 ) , Thompson , at 61 , is something of a legend in his own lifetime . 
He made his fortune during World War 2 , when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom . 
Even before he hit big money , he had begun buying modern paintings . 
He gave the impression of never having read a word about art , but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best . 
He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away , and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : `` I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about '' . 
He might barge into a gallery , start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting . 
He could be lavishly generous with friends , cab drivers and bellboys , but with dealers he was tough . 
He bought up Cezannes , Braques , Matisses , Legers , a splendid Picasso series , more than 70 Giacometti sculptures . 
He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world . 
All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw , outside Pittsburgh , and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them . 
Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city . 
But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum . 
Pittsburgh turned him down , just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years . 
He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler , with whom he had long been trading pictures . 
Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia , which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built . 
Last week most of the other prizes , once offered to Pittsburgh , went on the block . 
At the opening of the Dusseldorf show , Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time . 
In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them . 
Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town . 
Thompson himself said : `` I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures '' . 
Break in Georgia 
The University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color . 
But in all its 175 years , not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms . 
Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a `` qualified '' Negro boy and girl . 
Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education , from kindergarten through graduate school , in Georgia -- and in Alabama , Mississippi and South Carolina as well . 
For 18 months , Hamilton Holmes , 19 , and Charlayne Hunter , 18 , had tried to get into the university . 
They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School , where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third . 
The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts , but was careful never to mention the color of their skins . 
Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College , where he is a B student and star halfback . 
Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University . 
Last fall , after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court , Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again . 
Charlayne was `` tentatively '' admitted for next fall , after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State . 
But Holmes was rejected again `` on the basis of his record and interview '' . 
The evidence in court was testimony about the interview , which for Holmes lasted an hour , although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation . 
Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution , or a `` beatnik parlor or teahouse '' . 
No , said he , but officials still called him `` evasive '' . 
They also said he lied in saying that he had never been `` arrested '' . 
Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine , had his license suspended . 
Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students , found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes . 
The real reason for his rejection , they argued , is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school . 
Judge Bootle's decision : `` The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color '' . 
The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university . 
`` Surprised and pleased '' , Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week . 
Catch for Chicago 
When the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March , a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway . 
Out went letters to 60,000 old grads , asking for suggestions . 
Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted . 
Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors , including Adlai Stevenson , Richard Nixon , and Harvard's Dean McGeorge Bundy . 
The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator , but rather , as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it , `` a top scholar in his own right '' -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago . 
Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle , 57 , who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time , Cover , July 14 , 1958 ) . 
It fell to Chancellor Kimpton , now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive , to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins . 
He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses , raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100 , nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million . 
But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order , some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era . 
At Caltech , Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946 . 
But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot , recruit and excite able researchers , and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making . 
Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; ; 
he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal , and took delight in driving a $250 model A Ford for 22 years , then selling it for $300 . 
A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end . 
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date , and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away . 
The man was King Leopold 2 , of the Belgians , who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good . 
By force , he took under his protection , or stole , 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa . 
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; ; 
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity . 
Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; ; 
they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking . 
The population of the Congo is 13.5 million , divided into at least seven major `` culture clusters '' and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects . 
The religions of the people include Christianity , Mohammedanism , paganism , ancestor worship and animism . 
The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate . 
The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars . 
To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; ; 
it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done , or failed to do , in the Congo since 1885 . 
At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property . 
But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience . 
The Belgian government itself took over administration , commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism . 
One definition of paternalism is `` The principle or practice , on the part of a government , of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children '' . 
The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment . 
Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child , if one imagines him to have been born in 1908 , was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant . 
The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo , which is rich in copper , tin , cobalt , manganese , zinc , and uranium , and cotton and palm oil . 
The colony was administered from Brussels , with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote . 
The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock . 
In Inside Africa , John Gunther describes one of these , the Societe Generale , as `` the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if , let us say , the House of Morgan , Anaconda Copper , the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together , with the United States government as a heavy partner '' . 
Had they been truly ruthless , the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion . 
But they were not . 
They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; ; 
their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; ; 
they put much effort into public housing . 
They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food . 
But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month , the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often . 
Would not the children , if they received all their food on the first day of the month , eat it up immediately , and later go hungry ? ? 
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education . 
During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo . 
But almost all the schools were primary . 
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of `` la chatte '' and `` le chien '' and write his name . 
Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land , and trained many . 
But they did not believe in widespread secondary education , much less in college . 
It was their conviction that the people should be `` brought up together '' , a grade at a time , until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history , economics and political science . 
Indeed , the Belgians discouraged higher education , fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest . 
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were , among its 13.5 million people , exactly 14 university graduates . 
Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it ? ? 
In one large oversimplification , it might be said that the Belgians felt , far too late , the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa . 
They lacked time to prepare the Congo , as the British and French had prepared their colonies . 
The Congolese were clamoring for their independence , even though most were unsure what it meant ; ; 
and in Brussels , street crowds shouted , `` Pas une goutte de sang ! ! 
'' ( Not one drop of blood ! ! 
) . 
The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; ; 
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted , they would wash their hands of the mess . 
It is hard to blame them for this . 
Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless . 
As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties , or approximately eight for each university graduate . 
There were four principal ones . 
First , there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states , Balkanizing it . 
Second , there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-Balkanization , a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority , with much power residing in the states . 
Third , there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government . 
And fourth , there were moderates who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up . 
However , the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting . 
A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo , immediately after independence , was the provincial structure that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration . 
They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville , Kasai , Kivu , Katanga , Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with little regard for ethnic groupings . 
Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other , and to them independence meant an opportunity for war . 
The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier , and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces . 
Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations . 
If internal frictions arose , they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army , the Force Publique , which had been trained and was still officered by white Belgians . 
The president , Joseph Kasavubu , seemed an able administrator and the premier , Patrice Lumumba , a reasonable man . 
Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other . 
Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique -- many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes , erupted in mutiny , rioting , raping and looting . 
Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country . 
The Belgian government decided to act , and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo . 
On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga , Moise Tshombe , announced that his province had seceded from the country . 
Confusion became chaos ; ; 
each succeeding day brought new acts of violence . 
Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians , and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them . 
On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.N. into the Congo . 
Vague in wording , it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General `` to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary , until , through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations , the national security forces may be able , in the opinion of the Government , to meet fully their tasks . 
'' 
Secretary-General Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.N. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African , or at least nonwhite , nations -- certainly not from the U.S. , Russia , Great Britain or France . 
He quickly called on Ghana , Tunisia , Morocco , Guinea and Mali , which dispatched troops within hours . 
Ultimately the U.N. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000 , including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden , who were the only whites . 
It took the U.N. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo . 
The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.N. efforts . 
The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.N. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians , and appealed to Russia for help . 
( However , there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist . 
Before appealing to the U.N. or to Russia , he first appealed to the U.S. for military help , and was rejected . 
) Lumumba further complicated the U.N.'s mission by initiating small `` wars '' with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which , under Albert Kalonji , wanted to secede as well . 
Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo , sending Lumumba equipment for his `` wars '' , dispatching `` technicians '' and even threatening , on occasion , to intervene openly . 
But by the end of the three-month period , in October 1960 , something approaching calm settled on the Congo . 
President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him . 
Lumumba fired Kasavubu . 
Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu , chief of staff of the Congolese army . 
Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians , who have not since played any significant part on the local scene , although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.N. headquarters in New York . 
The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well , withdrawing all of their uniformed troops . 
But they left behind them large numbers of officers , variously called `` volunteers '' or `` mercenaries '' , who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga , the seceded province which , according to Tshombe , holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country . 
From October 1960 to February 1961 , the U.N. forces in the Congo took little action . 
There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters , and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation , whether to unify it , federalize it or Balkanize it . 
During the five-month lull , civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo . 
In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba , who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe , again stirred the U.N. to action . 
On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of `` all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo , including the use of force , if necessary , in the last resort '' . 
Although the resolution might have been far more specific , it was considerably tougher than the earlier one . 
It also urged that the U.N. eject , and prevent the return of , all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ; 
ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; ; 
urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army . 
The presidency : talking and listening 
Though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev , his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.S. foreign policy last week . 
High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte . 
On this issue , the President received a detailed report from his U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson , who had just returned from Paris , and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio . 
Ideally , the President would like the French to agree on a `` status quo ante '' on Bizerte , and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base . 
To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems , Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend . 
The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government , Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham , who flew to Washington last week to seek U.S. support . 
The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable . 
Through Ladgham , Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; ; 
and one U.S. official said : `` The key question now is which side picks up the phone first '' . 
On the Latin American front , the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ) . 
Main purpose of the meeting : To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress . 
And that was not all . 
In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper , diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng , Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.S. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations . 
Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; ; 
however the President , who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow , would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.S. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote . 
The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid . 
To Africa , he sent his most trusted adviser , his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast . 
All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; ; 
in effect , he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : `` We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk , and listen , with reason '' . 
Crime : ' skyjacked ' 
From International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston , as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies , is a routine five hours and 25 minutes , including stopovers at Phoenix , El Paso , and San Antonio . 
When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week , there was no reason to think it would take any longer . 
The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix . 
Thirty-one minutes later , when it took off for El Paso , hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard . 
At 3:57 a.m. , with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso , passenger Robert Berry , a San Antonio advertising man , glanced up and saw the man and boy , accompanied by a stewardess , walking up the aisle toward the cockpit . 
`` The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach '' , Berry said . 
`` I figured he was sick '' . 
John Salvador , a farmer from Palm Desert , Calif. , was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit . 
`` The kid had a automatic , like they issue in the Army '' , he said . 
`` The other fellow had a '' . 
Salvador saw the youth hold his against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey ; ; 
the man put his at the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards . 
To Rickards , a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air , it was an old story : His plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930 , when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa . 
But last week's pirates , like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek , Aug. 7 ) , wanted to go to Havana . 
Stalling : 
`` Tell your company there are four of us here with guns '' , the elder man told Rickards . 
The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message . 
But , he told the `` skyjackers '' , the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; ; 
they would have to refuel at El Paso . 
Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground . 
Jerry McCauley of Sacramento , Calif. , one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board , awoke from a nap in confusion . 
`` The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba '' , McCauley said , `` and like a nut I raised my hand . 
I thought he was the Air Force recruiter '' . 
What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages , along with the crew . 
They chose four : Jack Casey , who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; ; 
Fred Mullen from Mercer Island , Wash. ; ; 
Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine . 
Fla. , and Leonard Gilman , a former college boxer and veteran of the U.S. Immigration Service Border Patrol . 
Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m. . 
They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen , Border Patrol , sheriff's deputies , and FBI men , who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns . 
Other FBI men , talking with the pilot from the tower , conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana . 
The ground crew , which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes , took fully three hours . 
Still more time was consumed while the pilot , at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six , tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas Aj . 
Actually , the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; ; 
they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy , who thought at first , as did most others , that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707 . 
Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane , kept in touch throughout by telephone . 
At one time , while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot , the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba . 
As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains , police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment . 
From the luggage , they learned that the two air pirates , far from being Cubans , were native Americans , subsequently identified as Leon Bearden , 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge , Ariz. , and his son , Cody , 16 , a high-school junior . 
Tension 
The heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens . 
The father , by accident or perhaps to show , as he said , `` we mean business '' , took the and fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons . 
At 7:30 a.m. , more than three hours after landing , the Beardens gave an ultimatum : 
Take off or see the hostages killed . 
The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m. , and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway . 
Several police cars , loaded with armed officers , raced alongside , blazing away at the tires of the big jet . 
The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; ; 
the plane slowed to a halt . 
Ambulances , baggage trucks , and cars surrounded it . 
The day wore on . 
At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane . 
A few minutes later , FBI agent Francis Crosby , talking fast , eased up the ramp to the plane , unarmed . 
While Crosby distracted the Beardens , stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door . 
So did hostages Casey , Cleveland , and Mullen . 
That left only the four crew members , Crosby , and Border Patrolman Gilman , all unarmed , with the Beardens . 
The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand , the other in a hip pocket . 
Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance . 
He caught officer Simmons' eye , nodded toward young Bearden , and -- `` I swung my right as hard as I could . 
Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over '' . 
Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m. , the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines . 
( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro , and live high in Cuba . 
) Back home in Coolidge , Ariz. , his 36-year-old wife , Mary , said : `` I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs '' . 
Congress : more muscle 
Taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation . 
The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.S. history . 
With the money all but in hand , however , the Administration indicated that , instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested , the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000 . 
The `` hold-back '' , as Pentagon mutterers labeled it , apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and , thus , the new funds spent prudently . 
In all , the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion , which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy , but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for . 
( The Senate , on its own , decided to provide additional B-52 and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command . 
) The House , which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more , was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order . 
In other areas , Congressional action last week included : 
The Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign , not too unhappily . 
The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health , welfare , and labor activities . 
Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill , with its controversial long-range proposals , had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend . 
White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact . 
Food : stew a la Mulligatawny 
Most members of the U.S. Senate , because they are human , like to eat as high on the hog as they can . 
But , because they are politicians , they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter . 
As a result , ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building , the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it . 
Over the years , enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes , the menu has pursued its drab all-American course . 
Individual senators , with an eye to the voters back home , occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan , soft-shell crabs from Maryland , oysters from Washington , grapefruit from Florida . 
But plain old bean soup , served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ) , made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place . 
In a daring stroke , the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel . 
Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes . 
Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward . 
Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues . 
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative . 
Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds . 
Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing . 
That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates . 
As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes , investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments . 
Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds . 
Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21 , according to Standard & Poor's average . 
On balance , prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then . 
However , in the same three-month period , toll-road bonds , as a group , have bucked this trend . 
On these bonds , price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines . 
Tax-free returns . 
Investors , however , still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds . 
You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page . 
Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent , or very close to that . 
And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to , or beyond , the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds . 
That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds . 
It's not much more , in fact , than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds . 
For investors whose income is taxed at high rates , though , a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high . 
It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed , or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income . 
Swelling traffic . 
A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening . 
The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company , investment bankers . 
Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period . 
And there is the bright note : The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession . 
Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter . 
Indication : The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward . 
Look , for example , at the Ohio Turnpike . 
Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February , as compared with those same months in 1960 . 
Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs . 
As a result , the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds . 
That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months . 
That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike . 
Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961 , but up for the 12 months ending in March . 
Costs were held down , despite a bitter winter . 
For the year , the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs , against 121 per cent in the preceding period . 
The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston . 
Slow successes . 
Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do . 
The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway , for example , was not opened over its entire length until December , 1958 . 
In the 12 months ended in February , 1960 , the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves . 
In the 12 months ended in February , 1961 , this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest . 
That improvement is continuing . 
In the first two months of 1961 , earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960 . 
Success , for many turnpikes , has come hard . 
Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates . 
In these cases , the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases , or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways . 
Many rate increases already have been put into effect . 
Higher tolls are planned for July 1 , 1961 , on the Richmond-Petersburg , Va. , Turnpike , and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study . 
Easier access . 
Progress is being made , too , in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes . 
The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration . 
Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28 , 1961 . 
Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961 , with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita , and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City , Kans. , and Kansas City , Mo. . 
Meanwhile , there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years . 
For some roads , troubles . 
Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals . 
Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike . 
If nothing is done , the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 . 
West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months , and , despite recent improvement in revenues , holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same . 
These , however , are exceptions . 
The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement . 
It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full . 
Already , however , several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins . 
Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point . 
A top American official , after a look at Europe's factories , thinks the U.S. is in a `` very serious situation '' competitively . 
Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , accompanied by a member of our staff , on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat , the auto producer , and Olivetti , maker of typewriters and calculating machines . 
Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows -- 
`` Follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant , and you learn this : 
`` One , modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day . 
About half of these are exported . 
`` Two , wage costs are a fraction of the U.S. costs . 
A skilled worker on the assembly line , for example , earns $37 a week . 
`` Three , labor troubles are infrequent . 
Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years . 
`` Said Secretary Hodges : ' It's a tough combination for the U.S. to face . 
`` Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges . 
Olivetti took over Underwood , the U.S. typewriter maker , in late 1959 . 
Within a year , without reducing wages , Underwood's production costs were cut one third , prices were slashed . 
The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled . 
`` The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout , modern machinery . 
The firm is design-conscious , sales-conscious , advertising-conscious . 
`` Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.S. . 
The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.S. balance of payments . 
`` Hodges predicted : ' I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.S. . 
There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas ' '' . 
Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports . 
The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines . 
Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : 
An international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy . 
Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting . 
The U.S. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years . 
Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first , need encouragement to get on their feet . 
If they have trouble exporting , international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would . 
Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible . 
At the same time , another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries . 
Japan , since 1957 , has been `` voluntarily '' curbing exports of textiles to the U.S. . 
Hong Kong , India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the `` Lancashire Pact '' . 
None of these countries is happy with these arrangements . 
The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.S. While they have been curbing shipments , they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.S. market . 
Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain , while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly . 
The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons . 
The Kennedy hope is that , at the conference or through bilateral talks , the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that `` dumping '' practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas . 
Gradual , controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants . 
This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products . 
It's an important clue to Washington thinking . 
Note , too , that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.S. textile industry . 
`` Get competitive or get out '' . 
In veiled terms , that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry . 
The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines , where modernization doesn't seem feasible . 
Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed . 
Government research will look into new products and methods . 
Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved . 
But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas . 
Rather , they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products . 
What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries . 
Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.S. coal miners . 
Yet U.S. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water . 
Steel Company of Wales , a British steelmaker , wants to bring in Virginia coal , cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets . 
Virginia coal , delivered by ship in Wales , will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines . 
U.S. coal is cheap , despite high wages , because of widespread mechanization of mines , wide coal seams , attactive rates on ocean freight . 
Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting , narrow and very deep . 
Productivity of U.S. miners is twice that of the British . 
Welsh coal miners , Communist-led , are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal . 
They threaten to strike . 
The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.S. coal in . 
The British coal industry is unprofitable , has large coal stocks it can't sell . 
Every library borrower , or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals , knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically , `` I'm sorry , but we don't have that book . 
There wouldn't be much demand for it , I'm afraid '' . 
Behind this reply , and its many variations , is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face , from the largest to the smallest . 
What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles ? ? 
What to buy for adult and child readers , for lovers of fiction and nonfiction , for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified , when your budget is pitifully small ? ? 
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate . 
A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually , which includes the librarian's salary , and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city . 
The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse . 
Confronted with this situation , most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have , or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds . 
In some parts of the country , however , a co-operative movement has begun to grow , under the wing of state governments , whereby , with the financial help of the state , libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis . 
New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems , so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow . 
Because it is so large a state , with marked contrasts in population density , the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works . 
At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State , where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large , sparsely populated area . 
At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System , in a high-density area , with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve . 
Both these types , and those in between , are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950 , with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state . 
It was a step in the right direction , but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today . 
Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts . 
An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not , as they saw fit . 
Some library boards are wary of the plan . 
A large , well-stocked library , surrounded in a county by smaller ones , may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great . 
A small library may cherish its independence and established ways , and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board . 
Within a system , however , the autonomy of each member library is preserved . 
The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program , facilities , and services , but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system . 
All services are given without cost to members . 
So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system , and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day , not too distant , when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op . 
To set up a co-operative library system , the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus , and the system is organized around it . 
The collection may be in an existing library , or it may be built up in a central collection . 
Each system develops differently , according to the area it serves , but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency . 
The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served , and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita , if a library spends a certain number of dollars . 
In Nassau County , for example , the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City , the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons , a figure that has doubled since 1950 . 
This system , by virtue of its variety and size , offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation . 
The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service , what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge , and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area . 
The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries , adequate to satisfy everyday needs , could afford . 
Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters , which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965 . 
The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building , and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers . 
Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection , but there is also specialization in science and technology , an indicated weakness in local libraries . 
On microfilm , headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day , as well as bound volumes of important periodicals . 
The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans . 
Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day . 
It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany , which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide . 
The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries . 
Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area , which headquarters could then build upon . 
East Meadow has philosophy , psychology , and religion ; ; 
Freeport houses social science , pure science , and language ; ; 
history , biography , and education are centered in Hempstead ; ; 
Levittown has applied science , business , and literature ; ; 
while Hewlett-Woodmere is the repository of art , music , and foreign languages . 
The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant , and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service . 
This kind of cooperation is not wholly new , of course . 
Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century , but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis . 
Local libraries find , too , that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system , and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library . 
The system passes on these savings to its members . 
Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing . 
Books are not the only resource of the system . 
Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary , art , and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs , and to organizations in member communities . 
The most recent film catalogue , available at each library , lists 110 titles presently in the collection , any of which may be borrowed without charge . 
This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children , young adults , or adults , although some classics cut across age groups , such as `` Nanook Of The North '' , `` The Emperor's Nightingale '' , and `` The Red Balloon '' . 
Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries , teaching them the effective use of film as a library service . 
The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; ; 
consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities , cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences , workshops , and frequent visits . 
Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center , to provide better methods of purchasing and selection . 
Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters , where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups . 
Story hours , pre-school programs , activities with community agencies , and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant . 
Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days , threatening to expand beyond its boundaries . 
In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program , headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; ; 
it prepares cooperative displays ( posters , booklists , brochures , and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; ; 
it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; ; 
and it publishes Sum And Substance , a monthly newsletter , which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries . 
The system itself is governed by a board of trustees , geographically representing its membership . 
In Nassau , as in other systems , the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools , and on adult education in general . 
Librarians , a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication , can begin to see results today . 
Library use is multiplying daily , and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans , the teen-agers . 
To them especially the librarians , with the help of co-ops , hope they will never have to say , `` I'm sorry , we don't have that book '' . 
Today , more than ever before , the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned . 
The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world . 
The need for lifetime reading is apparent . 
Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives , for it is only through knowledge that we , as a nation , can cope with the dangers that threaten our society . 
The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life . 
We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; ; 
if we are not discriminating in our reading ; ; 
if we do not know how to use what we do read . 
We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age , as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word . 
A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries . 
Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America . 
The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge , and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word , continue to expand . 
The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition . 
There are , for example , approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service . 
In college libraries , 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.S. Office of Education . 
And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all . 
In every aspect of service -- to the public , to children in schools , to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services . 
Only public understanding and support can provide that service . 
This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week , April 16-22 , and for its theme : `` For a richer , fuller life , read '' ! ! 
Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things '' because `` you'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` Hey lookit Mr. America ; ; 
whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time ) '' ? ? 
After all , a guy's gotta have a little ego ! ! 
Therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! ! 
This happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada -- Henri De Courcy . 
Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments . 
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority , Professor Roland Claude . 
And they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . 
That's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal . 
Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ) . 
There's Gaetan D'Amours who is our newest Mr. Canada ; ; 
Jean-Paul Senesac , whose story appeared here two issues ago ; ; 
Jack Boissoneault , who was with us last month ; ; 
Charles Harve , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man '' subdivision award in the Mr. Canada event ; ; 
and a host of others . 
Yesiree , the professor knows his muscles ! ! 
Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight . 
About that time he began reading Mr. America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining . 
Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein , those two wonder-working Weider food supplements , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him . 
Well , sir they did real great ! ! 
For in almost less time than it takes to tell it , Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly . 
Of course he did some exercising . 
He's crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame . 
Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much . 
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body . 
It was muscular but it wasn't symmetrical . 
`` A real ' nothing ' torso '' , says Henri . 
`` It never seemed to widen . 
It just got longer and longer '' . 
That's when he went to Professor Claude . 
And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it . 
In his gym the professor has some of the most `` knocked out '' equipment since Vic Tanny . 
Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous Weider Push-Pull Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group . 
So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . 
As you can see , in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! ! 
Now when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 2 . 
Super-Set No. 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat benches . 
The `` push '' exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation . 
You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pecs . 
The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the Aj . 
The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell Bent-Arm Pullover . 
( Note how strongly the upper lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ) . 
In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the `` push '' exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms . 
The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ! ! 
This is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved . 
You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ! ! 
As you see , the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip . 
He has to ; ; 
he just can't do anything about it at all ! ! 
But as you can also see , it's not a painful exercise at all , because Henri De Courcy -- the `` happy '' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! ! 
The last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets . 
By this time Henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point , and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work . 
He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press ( note the high incline ) . 
This gives a wide flare to the pecs , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and Aj . 
This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests ; ; 
that steel-edged `` carved-out-of-solid rock '' looks of the great champions . 
So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , four of No. 2 , four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press , you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon . 
Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone . 
Rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe of true Herculean build . 
The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles . 
Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts . 
But contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel -- is something quite different . 
This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training , but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him . 
Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others . 
Because they are `` minority '' exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten . 
Only when the newest Mr. America or Mr. Universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are . 
The exercise I shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the One Leg Lunge . 
Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ! ! 
It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders ; ; 
a criterion of muscle `` drama '' that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike ; ; 
the facet of muscular development that wins prizes . 
Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable . 
The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts . 
But for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg Curling , Leg Extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed . 
Indeed , a lighter weight works much better because a greater , more extensive split can be performed . 
Used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ! ! 
Really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective : 1 . 
It's a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise . 
2 . 
It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition . 
3 . 
It improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder , and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed . 
4 . 
It increases flexibility of the legs . 
5 . 
It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort to be focused on each . 
You'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's done : 1 . 
Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean . 
2 . 
Place a suitably-loaded barbell across them ; ; 
grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; ; 
extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split . 
Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet . 
When the front knee is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands . 
3 . 
After you have taken a breather , reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear , and the rear thigh now to the front , and perform the same movement in the same manner . 
That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell . 
You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety . 
You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise . 
Oh , you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first . 
But don't worry . 
Before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ! ! 
Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck . 
Squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front . 
The most beautiful bed of pansies I've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day . 
Pansies are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun . 
I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather . 
He seemed puzzled by my question . 
`` I just love them '' , he said . 
The more I talked with him , the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming . 
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care . 
He planted the pansy seeds himself , buying them from a pansy specialist . 
These specialists , I learned , have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers . 
Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains . 
I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants . 
Occasionally , when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ; ; 
but pansy seeds , he told me , soon `` run down '' . 
It's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them . 
His soil was `` nothing special '' , just prairie land , but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose , spongy and brown-black . 
I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture , tilth and body . 
It isn't easy to describe it , but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil . 
Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies . 
They germinate quickly , the tiny plants appearing in a week , and grow along lustily . 
It doesn't really matter which month of the year you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours . 
I like to make a seedbed right in the open , though many people start them successfully in cold frames . 
Pansies don't have to be coddled ; ; 
they'd rather have things rugged , with only moderate protection on the coldest days . 
If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate . 
For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting . 
I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray . 
Then I cover the sowing with a board . 
This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds . 
Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby . 
When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board . 
A light , porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth . 
I like sawdust for this , or hay . 
When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants , it's time to set them out where they are to remain . 
Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller . 
The moral is : don't transplant it any oftener than you must . 
As soon as they are large enough to move , I put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom . 
I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant . 
That encourages rooting , and the better developed the roots , the larger and more plentiful the flowers . 
Pansies are gluttons . 
I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them . 
I spade lots of compost into their bed ; ; 
lacking that , decayed manure spread over the bed is fine . 
One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile , to which a little sand had been added , and I had the most beautiful pansies in my , or any of my neighbors' experience . 
In addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week , diluted to the color of weak tea . 
As a substitute for this , organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions , may be used . 
They need mulch . 
We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; ; 
now we must use a heavy one . 
Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool . 
When winter comes be ready with additional mulch . 
I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost . 
That keeps in the cold , retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing . 
Don't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter . 
Whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days , you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two . 
If those aren't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter blooming ? ? 
The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter . 
I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame . 
( An unheated greenhouse would have been better , if I had had one . 
) The plants took zero nights in their stride , with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them . 
In response to the lengthening days of February they budded , then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers . 
That cold frame was my morale builder ; ; 
its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it . 
Like strawberries in December , pansies are far more exciting in February than in May . 
Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it . 
The day will come , in midsummer , when you find your plants becoming `` leggy '' , running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms . 
Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth , using a bobby pin to hold it there . 
Pick the flowers , keep the soil dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season . 
As soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over , cut it off from the mother plant . 
A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops , leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch . 
These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring . 
I like to shear half my plants at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming . 
Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed . 
Nature's aim , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation . 
That done , her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant . 
Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds . 
Go to a reputable grower , preferably a pansy specialist . 
It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants than weak , sickly little things ; ; 
in fact it is easier . 
But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow . 
Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks , then their period of growth and bloom is over . 
That is not true . 
If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter , the second year is more prolific than the first . 
Would you like to grow exhibition pansies ? ? 
Remove about half the branches from each plant , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds . 
The flowers will be huge . 
Pansies have character . 
They stick to their principles , insist upon their due , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it . 
Treat them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones . 
Give them food , some shade , mulch , water and more food , and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty . 
A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal , but add an avocado and you have something really special . 
This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the United States . 
It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part of your diet yet , you really should . 
You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted . 
It is roughly shaped like a large pear , and when properly ripened , its dark green skin covers a meaty , melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear , but oily . 
The avocado should have a `` give '' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe . 
The flavor is neither sweet , like a pear , nor tart like an orange ; ; 
it is subtle and rather bland , nut-like . 
It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits . 
Sometimes it takes several `` eatings '' of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world . 
Once you become an avocado fan , you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation . 
Naturally dormant and no spray danger 
Today , refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world . 
The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree , but it is still firm at this point . 
It is brought to packing houses , cleaned and graded as to size and quality , and packed in protective excelsior . 
The fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-F. , a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state . 
This cooling does not change the avocado in any way , it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored . 
This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen . 
One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind . 
There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed . 
If the temperature is controlled properly , the avocado will delay its ripening until needed . 
And unlike other fruits , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado . 
It is thick , much like an egg plant's skin , so that poison sprays , if they are used , present no hazard to the consumer . 
Nutritious and a cholesterol reducer 
Good taste and versatility , plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit , even if its nutritional values were limited . 
Avocados , however , are very rich in nutrients . 
Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids , so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system . 
Aside from this , the average portion contains some protein , an appreciable amount of vitamins A and C -- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement , and about a third of the official vitamin E requirement . 
The B vitamins are well represented , especially thiamin and riboflavin . 
Calcium , phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts , and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts . 
None of these values is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration storage . 
Dr. Wilson C. Grant , of the Veterans' Administration Hospital , Coral Gables , Florida , and the University of Miami School of Medicine , set out to discover if avocados , because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids , would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients . 
The study comprised 16 male patients , ranging in age from 27 to 72 . 
They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol level of their blood . 
Then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption . 
Five , four , three , two , one , fire ! ! 
The tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard . 
The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach . 
Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear . 
Nuclear weapons are fearsome , but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying . 
A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets . 
It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker , in possession of such absolute power , would simultaneously destroy his opponent's cities and people . 
With a nation defenseless before it , why would the attacker spare the victim's people ? ? 
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation ? ? 
The nation would be utterly devastated . 
The will of its people , so crucial in time of peril , would be broken . 
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ; ; 
and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes . 
At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities , being `` soft '' , and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons . 
However , because this vulnerability is mutual , it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent's cities , at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal . 
It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic . 
ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways . 
They could be used to attack a nation's people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people ) , or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military force . 
If our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide , then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles . 
We must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves . 
We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile . 
Missiles are very valuable weapons , but they also have their too little known limitations . 
Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory , the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately . 
Placing missiles in submarines , on barges , railroads , highways , surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons . 
One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target , decide that it is worthy of destruction , select the missile to be fired against the target , compute ballistics for the flight , and prepare the missile for firing . 
Even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously , the ICBM still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes . 
Therefore , if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes , the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered . 
Because of this , it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability . 
In order to destroy the enemy's mobile , moving , or imprecisely located strategic forces , we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles . 
Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft , manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us . 
It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's citizens to cinders , we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us . 
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ICBM force . 
It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the B-52 or B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based missiles . 
If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets , it would seem that the B-52 or B-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapons . 
An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of Russia -- provided that we had used some of our ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses before our bombers got there . 
The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile , fleeting , and imprecisely located targets as well as the known , fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile . 
Why , then , aren't we planning a larger , more important role for manned military aircraft ? ? 
Is there any other way to do the job ? ? 
Survivability of our strategic forces ( Polaris , mobile and hardened Minuteman , hardened Atlas and Titan , and airborne Skybolt ) means that it will take some time , perhaps weeks , to destroy a strategic force . 
War , under these circumstances , cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation . 
Forces will survive a surprise attack , and these forces will give depth , or considerable duration , to the conflict . 
The forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed . 
Even mobile forces must be found and destroyed . 
But , how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces ? ? 
They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile . 
Some day , many years in the future , true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets . 
But until we have an effective spacecraft , the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft . 
However , the aircraft which we have today are tied to large , `` soft '' airfields . 
Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease . 
Here then is our problem : aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing ; ; 
but the airfield , on which the aircraft is completely dependent , is doomed by the missile . 
This makes today's aircraft a one-shot , or one mission , weapon . 
Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once . 
This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile . 
But remember this -- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets , it is the airfield . 
Eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles . 
There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground : 
Put aircraft in `` bomb-proof '' hangars when they are on the ground . 
Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3,000-foot ) airfields with runways . 
If we could use all the small airfields we have in this country , we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more . 
Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life . 
Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines , develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( VTOL ) long-range military aircraft . 
We have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 Aj . 
We could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters . 
Large , long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot runways , but they would require more powerful engines than we have today . 
There is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile . 
This same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft . 
One seldom hears the analogy `` nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine '' . 
If , for some reason such as economy , we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency , then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one . 
With powerplants such as these , vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built . 
For example , a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic VTOL fighter . 
With a 15-to-one engine , a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise vertically . 
The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete . 
When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields , they are no longer vulnerable to Aj . 
If our SAC bombers were , today , capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia again , and again , and again , those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance . 
We would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force -- whether it were fixed or mobile . 
With such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy , and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating . 
No need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy's military force . 
Our first necessity , at the very outset of war , is post-attack reconnaissance . 
In a few years we will have SAMOS ( semiautomatic missile observation system ) . 
But in the case of moving targets , and targets which have limited mobility , what will their location be when it is time to destroy them ? ? 
What targets have we successfully knocked out ? ? 
A ballistic missile cannot , today , tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful . 
What targets still remain to be hit ? ? 
These crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance . 
SAMOS will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark . 
Even if this is some day possible , there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target . 
If the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way , the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced . 
Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably . 
It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance . 
It could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night . 
It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the United States with the chance that the target , if it were mobile , would be gone . 
A large aircraft , such as the B-52 or B-70 , could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons . 
Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1,000 psi overpressure at 100 feet . 
Or put another way , the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ! ! 
It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons . 
Today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings , runways , taxi-ways , separate spans of bridges , etc. . 
With these keen `` eyes '' and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy , military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas . 
If we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision , and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace , our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening . 
The lyric beauties of Schubert's Trout Quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners . 
But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers , the work presents its problems . 
Since it requires only five players , it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass , an instrument generally regarded as symphonic . 
Moreover , the piece is written in five movements , rather than the conventional four of most quintets , and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor . 
The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing . 
Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions , with the contrabass given free rein . 
Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation . 
In these readings , the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background , or it is dressed in clown's attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop . 
Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches , when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances . 
The occasion for this marathon : Angel's long-awaited reissue in its `` Great Recordings Of The Century '' series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version . 
Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first . 
Whether considered alone or in relation to other editions , COLH 40 is a document of prime importance . 
Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart players of all time , and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable . 
But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer , and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford Curzon , Frank Glazer , Adrian Aeschbacher , and Victor Babin ) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical skills . 
Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions , most notably the `` Schnabel trill '' ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ) . 
But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student's approach as distinctly his own . 
Schnabel's emphasis on structural clarity , his innate rhythmic vibrancy , and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one . 
Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master , and as a result the playing here has humor , delicacy , and radiant humanity . 
This is a serious-minded interpretation , but it is never strait-laced . 
And although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications . 
The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives . 
About the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy . 
I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel didn't collaborate with the Budapest Quartet , whose rugged , athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group . 
From a technical standpoint , the string playing is good , but the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here . 
The violinist , in particular , is very indulgent with swoops and slides , and his tone is pinched and edgy . 
The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone , but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet . 
There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the `` Forellen '' movement , and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original Aj . 
Turning to the more modern versions , Curzon's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work . 
Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ) , and the gossamer shading throughout . 
Some of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky , however . 
Why , for example , does he favor two tempos , rather than one , for the third movement ? ? 
The assisting musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise , but their contribution is rustic and appealing . 
( Special compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp : his scrawny , tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance . 
) 
The Glazer-Fine Arts edition ( Concert-Disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization . 
It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble effort . 
But having lived with the disc for some time now , I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's . 
Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's , but the sound on his Decca disc is dated , and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it . 
The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet ( RCA Victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing . 
( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's keyboard manner , but his playing is of limited insight . 
) Badura-Skoda-Vienna Konzerthaus ( Westminster ) and Demus-Schubert Quartet ( Deutsche Grammophon ) are both warm-toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless . 
Helmut Roloff , playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble , gives a sturdy reading , in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists . 
Telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound , and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $2.98 ) is worthy of consideration . 
Returning once again to the Schnabel reissue , I am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist's musical penetration . 
Here is truly a `` Great Recording of the Century '' , and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect . 
This recording surely belongs in everyone's collection . 
Must records always sound like records ? ? 
From the beginning of commercial recording , new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation . 
Seen in perspective , many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones . 
Although lacking absolute verisimilitude , they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original . 
On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl Muck's baton , or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic . 
Since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago , the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold . 
In many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects : the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer . 
Other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics . 
If we return to them today , we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing . 
Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music . 
This difference is made up of many factors . 
Some of them are obvious , such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings . 
( Music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat . 
) From the technical standpoint , records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color , texture , complexity , range , intensity , pulse , and pitch of the original . 
Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion , although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests . 
Yet it is the accumulation of distortion , the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness , that makes records sound like records . 
The sound may be good ; ; 
but if you know The Real Thing , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation . 
Command's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one . 
Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High Fidelity , Sept. 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects . 
Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers' triumph . 
The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values . 
The engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness . 
The effect of the recording is very open and natural , with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance . 
This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity , but it eliminates listener fatigue . 
A contributing factor is the perspective , the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained . 
The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes , valve clicks , and other noises incidental to playing . 
Yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand , and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall . 
Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation . 
The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority ; ; 
yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer . 
The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance . 
All of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction . 
For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors . 
Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score , discounting tradition , and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper . 
Those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one . 
Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm , the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect . 
The Presto Ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro con Spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet . 
In the end , however , the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings . 
Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score , and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song . 
The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result . 
Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment . 
The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration . 
Your ear takes you into the ensemble , and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score . 
It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener . 
The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer's four-sided LP edition of 1958 for Angel ) , this set is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment . 
The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly , if suave , sentimentality . 
And in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance , the recording sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super-high fidelity '' . 
The home listener is overpowered , all right , but the experience is a far from pleasant one . 
As with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff's abridgment for RCA Victor ) I find the cleaner , less razor-edged monophonic version , for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness , the more aurally tolerable -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my SD copies . 
At the Westminster KC Dog Show in Madison Square Garden , New York on the second day , the Finals of the Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class . 
The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky . 
This year several entries from Canada were entered which made the Junior Class International . 
Forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present . 
It was interesting to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class . 
As has been the custom for the past several years , John Cross , Jr. , Bench Show Chmn. of Westminster , arranged for the Juniors' meeting before the Class , and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them . 
Over 60 Juniors , parents and guests attended . 
Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. speaks 
After the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the Junior Class , Mrs. William H. Long , Jr. was introduced as the first speaker . 
In her opening remarks Mrs. Long also welcomed the Juniors and stated , `` There isn't any other show quite like Westminster . 
I know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break . 
Mrs. Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years . 
Twenty years ago her daughter Betsey Long , then 13 years of age , won the Grand Challenge Trophy , Children's Handling Class ( as they were called then ) at Westminster . 
No sooner had Betsey come out of the ring than Mrs. Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch. Cadet or Noranda , another home-bred product , and won ! ! 
Speaking from long years of experience , Mrs. Long advised the Juniors : `` When showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement , stop ! ! 
Dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ! ! 
When you and your dog step into the Junior ring , it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do . 
If you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog , he will feel it and give you a good performance ! ! 
He knows your signals , what is expected of him and the way the Class is conducted , right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers '' . 
Right attitude essential ! ! 
`` Take away your attitude '' , said Mrs. Long , `` and what have you left ? ? 
Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ! ! 
Or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look , or the date you have after the Class , or you are just doing this to please the parents . 
`` The reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce . 
Aids sounds more like a Pony Club , or horsemanship classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ! ! 
`` Your aids are your attitude , which comes through your voice , your hands and legs -- voice to encourage , discourage or whatever the need may be ; ; 
hands to guide or restrain ; ; 
legs to produce motion and rate of speed . 
Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right '' . 
Mrs. Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and stated , `` Have fun ! ! 
And may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come '' ! ! 
Harvey Barcus , second speaker 
The second speaker was Harvey Barcus , President of the Dog Writers Ass'n of America . 
Mr. Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for Juniors -- with which he is very familiar . 
Last year a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000 . 
He gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship . 
`` Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged '' ! ! 
Is one of Mr. Barcus' strong beliefs . 
He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should take a more active part in encouraging the Junior Division ! ! 
In closing , Mr. Barcus also wished all the Juniors luck in their Class . 
Westminster Show Notes 
Instead of 3 a.m. in the past , the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45 p.m. . 
This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ! ! 
Before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up , they could relax with their dogs . 
From there on , each Junior was going to be judged individually . 
This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour , 45 minutes to judge the Class . 
Anne Hone Rogers judges 28th finals 
This year Anne Hone Rogers , outstanding Handler , judged the Class . 
This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class . 
As the Juniors entered the ring , Mr. Spring , the announcer , stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the Finals of the Junior Competition . 
Juniors competed last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club , recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this Class -- the Finals for the year . 
A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class was eligible . 
( The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen . 
Many adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class . 
) 
It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered . 
A large number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners . 
After the judge moved all the dogs individually , she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring . 
She then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship . 
International Champion of the year 
Betty Lou Ham , age 16 , Holyoke , Mass. , showing an Irish Setter , was chosen as International Champion of the year . 
She was awarded the Professional Handlers' Ass'ns' Leonard Brumby , Sr. Memorial Trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the Junior Classes . 
) 
Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year . 
In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year , she also scored with an Afghan . 
Other winners 
Sydney Le Blanc , age 15 , Staten Island , N.Y. , showing a Doberman Pinscher , was 2nd . 
Susan Hackmann , age 14 , from Baltimore , Md. , showing a Dachshund , was 3rd . 
Last year Susan also placed 3rd in the Finals at Westminster . 
From the records we keep -- Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in both United States and Canada . 
Karen Marcmann , age 16 , Trapp , Penna. , showing a Keeshond was 4th . 
Most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as well . 
Entries increasing -- requirements raised 
In 1960 , there were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes . 
Each year these shows have increased in entries . 
Next year 1962 , at Westminster , the Bench Show Committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more Junior Classes in the open division only to qualify for Westminster . 
Percy Roberts , a leading judge will not be at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March . 
Judging class for intermediates proposed 
It has been suggested many times that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter the Junior Classes . 
For some time this writer has been suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class . 
Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester KC Show recently . 
Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class , but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day . 
The Intermediates in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the Judge . 
We suggested this Class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows . 
At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world . 
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance . 
Last year Robert Harris , a leading Junior Handler entered the Dog Judging Contest ( Junior ) at the International KC of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior since the Class' inception . 
Juniors who attend this Chicago show should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help to them . 
More volunteer handlers needed to judge 
Superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition . 
The founder of the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby , Sr. ( for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster ) was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division . 
Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog . 
To overcome this unfair judging , the A.K.C. requires that a licensed Handler be present to judge the Class . 
If the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from Handlers , it has been suggested that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class . 
By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world , all will be helping to create future dog owners . 
Other awards for Juniors 
The Airedale Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any Show . 
The Kansas City and the Topeka KCs are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for Westminster . 
The Rio Grande KC is also considering having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify with points for Westminster . 
The American Pointer Club is still continuing to donate trophies to Juniors who win at Junior Showmanship Classes with Pointers . 
Traveling through the South -- over 16,000 miles -- with two Great Danes , an Afghan , and a Persian kitten , we've worked up a regular routine for acceptance at motels . 
My husband enters the motel office , signs up for a room , and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets . 
`` Puppies '' ? ? 
Comes the suspicious question . 
`` No '' , he replies , `` full grown , adult show dogs , housebroken , and obedience-trained '' . 
We've never been refused ! ! 
Once settled , we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot , keep them under control in the room , and feed and bench them where they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture . 
In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin ! ! 
Many a motel owner -- when we've stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children . 
So many times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination . 
Is it that they don't care ? ? 
Are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient ? ? 
At one time , to most Americans , unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water , boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen , rich people , and the United States Navy . 
Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport . 
There are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade . 
About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960 . 
Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea . 
Boats are operated in every state in the Union , with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West . 
The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident , expectedly , in the areas where boats have always been found : the natural lakes , rivers , and along the nation's coastline . 
But during the last several years boats were launched in areas where , a short time ago , the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock . 
Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government , vast , man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit , providing boating and fishing havens all over the country . 
No matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the Southwest had been , for example , they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake Texoma , located between Texas and Oklahoma , which resulted when the Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River . 
In 1959 , according to the Engineers , Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000 persons . 
Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people , means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water . 
Providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000 boat trailers now in use . 
It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new , light , strong , easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000 . 
The sight of sleek inboards , outboards , and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace . 
Boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year-'round anchorage for their craft , will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car , driving to the water , and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat . 
Today , the boat , on its trailer , is brought to the gear and loaded at the door . 
Arriving at the waterside , the boat is launched , the family taken aboard and , that easily , another day afloat is begun . 
And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago . 
This year , Americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation's national , regional and local boat shows . 
The boats of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons . 
The variety of craft on the country's waters today is overwhelming . 
They range from an eight-foot pram , which you can build yourself for less than $50 , to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000 . 
Boat prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs . 
In this respect , boats can be compared with houses . 
There is no limit to what you can spend , yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget . 
There is no question as to just what is available . 
You name it , our industry is producing it , and it probably is made in different models . 
There are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips . 
There are houseboats which are literally homes afloat , accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience . 
You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft , sail , power , or both , or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond . 
You may have your boat of wood , canvas , plywood , plastic , or metal . 
You may order utility models , inboard or outboard , with or without toilets , galleys , and bunks . 
You may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose . 
Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block , to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash , color , flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat . 
You pay your money and you take your choice . 
American technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American boating . 
I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors , Americans excel over any country in the world in the long run . 
Russia , whose technology is not quite primitive , is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor , for instance . 
Now here is truly a marvel . 
The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower , unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production . 
These engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease , wherein lies their greatest advantage . 
Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook , the range being about $150 to $1,000 , depending on size . 
Great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country ; ; 
and to making the owning of a boat simpler . 
There was a time when , if a man wanted to purchase a boat , it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel . 
Having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended . 
Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later . 
Terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles . 
Of course , individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning power , credit rating and local bank policy . 
Outboard motors , insurance , and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats . 
Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances . 
When the automobile was in its embryonic stage , such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where , when and how fast a car could go . 
When air travel was in its infancy , the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all . 
Man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft . 
It was much the same with pleasure boating at first . 
Come one , come all , the water's fine ! ! 
As the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past , so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do ; ; 
must and should do . 
However , there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating . 
Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower . 
What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line . 
The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used . 
If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats , you must apply for a number from the U.S. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways . 
State numbering laws differ from each other in many ways . 
Fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft , such as sailboats with no power , to be registered at all . 
Many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators . 
Generally , states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities . 
It is always wise to consult your marine dealer , local yacht or boat club secretary , or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are . 
Ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land ; ; 
lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy . 
Hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed safety program . 
Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport , the industry has been supporting an intense , coordinated educational program with great success since 1947 . 
A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers . 
The industry has been its own watch dog . 
With U.S. Coast Guard cooperation , the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety . 
Industry interest in safety goes even farther . 
In 1959 , the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment . 
A new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at Atlantic City , New Jersey , to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe . 
In addition to these activities , the NAEBM , with headquarters at 420 Lexington Avenue , New York City , as well as other associations and individual manufacturers , provide and distribute films , booklets , and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat . 
It is important to note the work of the United States Power Squadrons and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary . 
Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling . 
These are not governmentally subsidized organizations . 
This year , over 100,000 persons will receive this free instruction . 
As America on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts , motels , and drive-in establishments where you can dine , see a movie , shop , or make a bank deposit , the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them . 
Instead of motels , for the boatman there are marinas . 
The word marina was coined by NAEBM originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort . 
Currently , marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available : gasoline , fresh water , electricity , telephone service , ice , repair facilities , restaurants , sleeping accommodations , a general store , and a grocery store . 
Yachtel , a relatively new word , indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services . 
Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel . 
It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards . 
Regardless of nomenclature , yachtels and boatels are marinas . 
Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas . 
A recent survey disclosed there are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the United States , the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats . 
The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle , but once understood , the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement . 
In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves . 
The main set of bars are the `` tappets '' and one tappet is connected to each lever . 
If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch , the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time . 
Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars . 
These can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets . 
The number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented . 
In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides , and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called `` dogs '' . 
Two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar . 
These slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved , locking and unlocking them . 
Here's how the scheme works : Suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal . 
This also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side , thus moving one or more locking bars . 
The dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets . 
By this scheme , pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal . 
Interlocking signals are normally at stop or `` red '' position , and a lever must be pulled to `` clear '' the signal . 
This is not necessarily to green , however , for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the `` plant '' . 
There are other basic rules . 
A turnout may have two levers , one to actually move the switch points , the other to lock the points . 
A signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked . 
Such locks are nearly always used where the switch points `` face '' oncoming traffic . 
The lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point . 
If the points aren't thrown all the way , the Turnout cannot be locked , and in turn , the signal cannot be cleared . 
Generally , these locks on turnouts are called `` facing point locks '' . 
Figs. 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals . 
Each diagram is accompanied by a `` dog chart '' , a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled . 
The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars . 
By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several other details . 
Derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a `` stop '' signal -- are used in many instances . 
`` Home '' signals have two blades . 
The blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move . 
As an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the `` distant '' signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant . 
In some low-speed situations , the distant signal is fixed at caution . 
In other instances where there is no automatic block signaling , the distant has only green and yellow aspects . 
So much for the prototype . 
The interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on Paul Larson's railroad follows the Fig. 1 scheme and is shown beginning in Fig. 7 , page 65 , and in the photos . 
Here's how it can be built . 
Frame 
The sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig. 7 , most of the bars being 1/8'' '' brass in 1/4'' '' and 1/2'' '' widths . 
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish . 
Our instructions assume you are building this particular frame , which is for a junction . 
When cutting the pieces , dress the ends smooth , and square with a smooth file or sanding disk . 
Start with the right-hand piece `` B '' , Af , soldering it to the lower piece `` A '' of the same material but 12'' '' long . 
Let exactly 1'' '' of `` A '' extend beyond `` B '' and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees . 
Now lay 12 pieces of Af cut 5-3/4'' '' long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2'' '' sq. . 
This gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece `` B '' . 
Compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for `` B '' . 
Solder this second `` B '' to `` A '' at right angles . 
There should be 10'' '' between the two parallel members and each should be 1'' '' from an end of the long piece . 
Cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a Af bar . 
Tack-solder all the 1/2'' '' sq. pieces to the 10'' '' and 12'' '' members . 
These will be drilled and tapped later on . 
Now cut five Af locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ) . 
Position these using six intermediate temporary Af spacers and locate the upper 12'' '' bar `` A '' . 
Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame . 
Now place 12 pieces 1/2'' '' sq. on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4'' '' long `` tappets '' , as they are called . 
Cap with a Af bar and tack-solder in place . 
Cap the locking bar spacers with two Af directly under the first two `` B '' pieces . 
Remove all the loose spacing bars . 
Mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together . 
See Fig. 7 . 
Placement of these holes is not critical , but they should be located so that the centers are about 1/8'' '' from any edge . 
Drill all No. 50 and counter-drill all except the `` A '' pieces size 43 . 
Tap the `` A '' pieces 2-56 . 
Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12'' '' and the first two 3-3/4'' '' bars ( `` A '' and `` B '' pieces ) , which are soldered together . 
Either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions . 
Dress all surfaces with a file , cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs . 
Drill 20 No. 47 holes in the upper piece `` A '' as shown in Fig. 7 . 
Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on . 
Note , 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts . 
Now reassemble the frame , using Af roundhead steel screws and nuts . 
Put the 12 tappets and some Af locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws . 
Be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' '' sq. spacer . 
As an anchor for the spring lock , insert a Af bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in Fig. 7 . 
Drill a No. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw . 
Drill two No. 50 holes , one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it , and tap 2-56 . 
Number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots . 
Remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth . 
Cut five pieces of Af brass bar stock 3-3/4'' '' long . 
These are supporting members for the short locking bars . 
Locate their positions in Fig. 7 and drill No. 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame . 
Cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut . 
Drill four No. 19 and four No. 28 holes in the 12'' '' long `` A '' pieces . 
Locate the position from Fig. 7 . 
Tappets and locking bars 
Draw-file No. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends . 
Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer . 
Drill a No. 50 hole 1-1/4'' '' from one end and tap 2-56 . 
( See Fig. 7 . 
) Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole , cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar . 
To find the other stop screw position , insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge . 
Scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet , 1/4'' '' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 5/64'' '' ) away from the frame edge . 
Total distance is about 21/64'' '' . 
Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4'' '' tappet movement . 
Drill a No. 50 hole , tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end . 
Drill a No. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in Figs. 7 and 8 . 
Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars . 
To each tappet except 6 and 8 , solder a Af piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs. 6 and 8 . 
These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts . 
Fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws , tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times . 
As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible . 
A little extra work here will pay off with a smooth , snug-fitting machine when you are finished . 
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting . 
The order of fitting is not too important . 
However , we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back . 
Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout , we will only describe the construction of one locking bar . 
Figs. 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions . 
All the bars are cut from Af brass . 
The lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of Fig. 7 . 
Bar `` C '' is 2-3/4'' '' long . 
Draw-file the edges , square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame . 
Fig. 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes . 
Center-punch and drill the No. 31 hole 7/16'' '' from one end of the bar . 
Chuck a length of 1/8'' '' dia. drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8'' '' long . 
Cut the piece about 9/32'' '' or 5/16'' '' long and drive it into the No. 31 hole drilled in the locking bar . 
File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' '' above the bar . 
This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 . 
Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 . 
Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 , parallel to piece `` A '' . 
See the drawings for the shape of the notch . 
Scribe V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool . 
We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about 
'' thick and 1'' '' dia. fitted on a 1/8'' '' dia. mandrel . 
Such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts . 
File to a smooth finish . 
A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one . 
Endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible . 
The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it . 
Assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces . 
All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis . 
Chuck a 2'' '' or 3'' '' piece of 1/8'' '' dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool . 
Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64'' '' long on one end , using Swiss pattern files . 
This tool can also be made with a lathe . 
Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics . 
Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing , standardizing , and communicating the things they discover and learn . 
Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are , therefore , essential to any scientific endeavor . 
Hot rodding is a science . 
It's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is , nevertheless , a science . 
But because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician . 
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; ; 
however , he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding . 
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem . 
It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed . 
The first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula . 
This changes the formula to an `` equation '' . 
The equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem . 
Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated . 
They involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes . 
However , it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order . 
They indicate simple division , multiplication , subtraction , and addition . 
The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other . 
The lower number is always divided into the upper number : Af 
. 
The symbol for multiplication is `` **b '' . 
It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row . 
For example : Af . 
Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order . 
The result will be the same regardless of the order used . 
The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign . 
This is nothing more than a dash . 
It separates two or more numbers . 
The number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol . 
For example : Af . 
When more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct . 
For example , for the problem Af , 10 from 25 equals 15 , then 6 from 15 equals 9 . 
Addition is indicated by the + symbol . 
The symbol is used to separate two or more numbers . 
For example : Af . 
Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order . 
When solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps , do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value . 
Multiplication , subtraction , and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right . 
Completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication , subtraction , or addition steps : Af . 
This would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12 . 
This part of the equation would then become 4 . 
For use in formulas , fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents . 
The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart . 
Charts for this purpose are available from many sources . 
They are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments . 
The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places . 
Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result . 
Some formulas contain `` constants '' . 
A constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation . 
It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly . 
Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport . 
The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and , quite often , are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events . 
When it is needed , one formula is as important as another . 
However , some formulas are used more than others . 
We'll take them in the general order of their popularity . 
Engine displacement 
A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine . 
Displacement is sometimes referred to as `` swept volume '' . 
Most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions . 
It is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed . 
Factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders , the length of the piston stroke , the number of cylinders in the engine , and a constant . 
The constant is , which is one-quarter of 3.1416 , another constant known as `` pi '' . 
Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles . 
Actually , the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine . 
The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length , which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders . 
Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine's total displacement . 
The formula is : Af . 
Dimensions in inches , and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches . 
Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc. ) . 
One inch equals 2.54 centimeters : one cubic inch equals 16.38 cubic centimeters . 
For example , let's consider a standard 283 cubic inch Chevy Aj . 
These engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches . 
The formula , with the fractions converted to decimals , becomes Af . 
To arrive at the answer , multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right . 
The different steps will look like this : Af 
. 
Compression ratio 
A cylinder's compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume , or its displacement , with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber . 
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid . 
Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : Af . 
To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head , install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level . 
Then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface . 
Do not overfill the chamber . 
This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension . 
Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber . 
The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity . 
Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc. ) , making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches . 
However , the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters . 
The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used . 
The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms . 
The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch . 
Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final computation . 
The volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume . 
Another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position . 
Compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth . 
The formula for this step is : Af . 
This volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening . 
The total of these three volumes is the `` final combustion chamber volume '' . 
After the factors just described have been computed , they are applied to the following formula : Af 
. 
For an example let's dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches . 
Applying these figures to the formula we get the equation : Af . 
The compression ratio is 10 to 1 . 
This method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads . 
Any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible , with normal means , to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed . 
The only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position . 
Gear ratio -- speed relationships 
There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed , engine speed , rear axle gear ratio , and rear tire size . 
By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three . 
To simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors . 
These are 
MPH for Car speed 
, for Engine crankshaft speed 
, for Rear axle gear ratio 
, for Tire size 
. 
Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly . 
This is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft . 
A tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made . 
The measurement must be in inches . 
Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics . 
When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula . 
To determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed , gear ratio , and tire size , the formula is : Af . 
For an engine speed of 5000 rpm , a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1 , and a tire radius of 13 inches , the equation would look like this : Af 
. 
To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is : Af . 
Using the same figures as for the previous example , the equation becomes : Af 
. 
To determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors , the formula is : Af . 
Using the figures from the previous examples , the equation becomes : Af . 
Orlando , Fla. , Feb. 2 
-- The best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner ( Mainliner-Highland Ellen ) , a member of the Dick Williams stable , who was clocked 2:25 . 
She is owned by Ralph H. Kroening , Milwaukee , Wis. , who , according to the railbirds , can feel justly proud of her . 
Other good miles have been by Debonnie ( Dale Frost-Debby Hanover ) and Prompt Time ( Adios-On Time ) in 2:28-:36 ; ; 
Kimberly Gal ( Galophone-Kimberly Hanover ) 2:26.2 ; ; 
Laguerre Hanover ( Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover ) and Monel ( Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd ) in 2:34 . 
Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body , plenty of heart girth , stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait . 
This colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them . 
Monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races . 
Stardel ( Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover ) , 2:34 , looks quite promising . 
Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-Fay ) , Caper ( Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover ) and Isaac ( Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago . 
Fury and Caper worked in 2:35 and did it with ease . 
They are two good colts of different type . 
Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side , and Caper is more the compact type . 
I have never seen Caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but ' trot ' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so . 
Fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect , with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground . 
Trackdown ( Torrid-Mighty Lady ) has worked a mile in 2:33.3 . 
It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace . 
Then , after emasculation , he was eased up for a couple of weeks . 
He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse . 
Thor Hanover ( Adios-Trustful Hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual , with solid , rugged conformation , good , flat bone and excellent feet . 
This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November , and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days , and then put to cart and broken in very nicely , knowing nothing but trot . 
He appeared in the hopples about November 14 , was treated for worms on the 18th , the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace . 
On December 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around , out in third position all the way . 
This colt has done everything asked of him , and done it with ease . 
His best mile to date is 2:32.2 . 
Gamecock ( Tar Heel-Terka Hanover ) is another promising colt , and his best time is 2:32.2 . 
This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center . 
The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare ; ; 
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff . 
The fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman . 
Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat . 
But up to date he has shown as much as any in the big Simpson stable . 
Hustler ( Knight Dream-Torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt , not the best gaited , but he surely can pace and is right there with them , and sometimes leading them , in the best miles . 
Torrid Freight ( Torrid-Breeze On Hal ) is a very rugged , strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him . 
His best time is around 2:33 . 
Strongheart ( Adios-Direct Gal ) , a fair-looking sorrel colt , knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles . 
Torrid Adios ( Torrid-Adios Molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts , but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds . 
Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks , he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me . 
First Flyer ( Frisco Flyer-Castle Light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes . 
His best time is 2:33.2 . 
The colts in Simpson's stable have little if anything on the fillies , especially the pacers . 
Justine Hanover ( Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4 weeks ago . 
Mrs. Freight ( Knight Dream-Miss Reed ) shows promise and does it in good form , and her best time is about 2:35 . 
Hoopla ( Tar Heel-Holiday Hanover ) , a filly that wanted to trot , knocked herself October 31 and November 1 fighting the hopples . 
She was then trained on the trot until December 29 , hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again . 
This time she submitted and in a few days was going good . 
On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1--:38 ; ; 
on Jan. 18 2:37.3--:36.1 ; ; 
on Jan. 21 , , 2:36 . 
This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters , Valentine Day and Cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning . 
She is more like her full brother , Taraday Hanover , but larger . 
Up to date she is a grand-looking filly . 
Pete Dailey has four promising 2-year-old pacers . 
Marquis Pick ( Gene Abbe-Direct Grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time . 
He is a fine-looking colt with a good body , good set of legs and nice way of going . 
His best mile to date is 2:28-:33 . 
Majestic Pick comes next , with a mile in 2:30-:33.2 . 
This colt is another fine-looking equine . 
Staley Hanover ( Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover ) is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class . 
Best time to date is 2:34-:34 . 
Step Aside ( Direct Rhythm-Wily Widow ) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows promise . 
Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked from 2:40 to 2:35 . 
Bonnie Wick ( Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary ) has gone in 2:36 ; ; 
Hickory Ash ( Titan Hanover-Misty Hanover ) in 2:35 . 
The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself , `` that must be Hickory Ash '' . 
She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot . 
Hickory Hill ( Star's Pride-Venus Hanover ) has gone in 2:33 ; ; 
Hickory Spark ( Harlan-Hickory Tiny ) 2:37 ; ; 
Buxton Hanover ( Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover ) 2:35 ; ; 
Faber's Kathy ( Faber Hanover-Ceyway ) 2:37 ; ; 
Honor Rodney ( Rodney-Honor Bright ) around 2:40 . 
The last-named is a fine-looking , large colt , who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries . 
He is going sound again now , and looks good . 
Brief Candle ( Harlan-Marcia ) has gone in 2:37 ; ; 
Lena Faber ( Faber Hanover-Chalidale Lena ) 2:33 ; ; 
Martha Rodney ( Rodney-Miss Martha D. ) 2:35 ; ; 
Checkit ( Faber Hanover-Supermarket ) 2:35 ; ; 
Charm Rodney ( Rodney-The Charmer ) 2:37 ; ; 
Fair Sail ( Farvel-Topsy Herring ) 2:36 ; ; 
Custom Maid ( Knight Dream-Way Dream ) 2:34.2 ; ; 
Jacky Dares ( ( Meadow Gene-Princess Lorraine ) 2:36 ; ; 
Good Flying ( Good Time-Olivette Hanover ) 2:36 ; ; 
Bordner Hanover ( Tar Heel-Betty Mahone ) 2:34 ; ; 
Faber's Choice ( Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet ) 2:36 ; ; 
Invercalt ( Florican-Inverness ) 2:35 ; ; 
Duffy Dares ( Meadow Gene-Princess Mite ) 2:36 ; ; 
Harold J. ( Worthy Boy-Lady Scotland ) 2:36 ; ; 
Knightfall ( Knight Dream-Miss Worthy Grapes ) 2:36 ; ; 
Next Knight ( Knight Dream-Next Time ) 2:36 ; ; 
Trader Jet ( Florican-My Precious ) 2:37 ; ; 
Trader Rich ( Worthy Boy-Marquita Hanover ) 2:37 ; ; 
Good Little Girl ( Good Time-Mynah Hanover ) 2:36 ; ; 
Iosola Hanover ( Kimberly Kid-Isoletta Hanover ) 2:36 . 
The last-named is one of the favorites in the stable , and the boys like her very much . 
I will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future . 
I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile in 2:34 , last quarter in :35.3 . 
In going away Debonnie got behind several lengths , stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy . 
They left the three-quarters together and finished almost together . 
Prompt Time shows class . 
This filly is another Adios that wants to trot , and trot she did until forced to do otherwise . 
After well broken and equipped with 12-oz. shoes on behind , bare-footed in front , she would trot a real storm with the master , Delvin , driving . 
Being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled . 
She hesitated , she hopped , she rolled and rocked , skipped and jumped , but in some two weeks she started to pace , From that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds . 
Rain on Friday prevented many workouts , but there were a few miles of note on Thursday .

The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he's always on the lookout for new and better arms . 
He's more than a reader of outdoor articles ; ; 
he's a real hunter and shooter , eager to improve his sport . 
Well , if you're that kind of sportsman we're here to help you . 
You've probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack , but it's not easy to decide on a new one . 
You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most ; ; 
the time to decide on them is now . 
As a Christmas service , I've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models . 
Here they are , with my comments and judgments . 
Read on , take your pick -- and start dropping those hints . 
First on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense . 
For me , a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design . 
Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts . 
Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans ; ; 
it's a short , light , quick-handling , fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail . 
Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little Magnum cartridge was a real work horse . 
Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot , and the Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck , kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency ; ; 
these are fairly large , tough animals . 
The deadliness of the Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me . 
At least five years ago , Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber , using the now defunct Model 90 action in 20-gauge size . 
After figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact , we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test gallery . 
We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments : Three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then , unaccountably , one could stray far out of the group . 
Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet . 
The new , jacketed slug in Magnum corrected this . 
But even without jacketed bullets , I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year . 
Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket , and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards . 
He moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling . 
Three more deer have fallen to this same gun , and all were one-shot kills . 
My double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ) , and although it compares well in other respects , it's considerably heavier than the Deerstalker , which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds . 
If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter , this is it . 
The Deerstalker points with the ease , speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun , and its trigger pull is light and sharp . 
The 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 fps , which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges . 
With five shots at the immediate command of the hunter's trigger finger , the gun and load are a deadly combination . 
The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the 
Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire . 
At present it's available in one model , the fine and familiar Smith & Wesson Magnum revolver ( about $110 ) , long a top-quality handgun among target arms . 
The velocity of this 
, 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 fps , and it's the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range . 
This is a varmint load , pure and simple ; ; 
it's much too explosive for small edible game . 
It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers . 
The most intriguing aspect of the S & W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard 
rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers . 
You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( Jet vs. rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting . 
The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine ; ; 
I tested it in my scoped S & W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily . 
Hunting rifles , '61 
The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models , actions and calibers . 
Aside from the Ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time . 
Here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models . 
Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action , high-power rifles . 
They have fine FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood . 
Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available , and these include the standard bores ( about $165 ) plus the Magnums ( around $170 ) ; ; 
the latter include the 
, S & H , , and . 
Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the 
. 
Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes . 
Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions , regardless of caliber . 
The 
have the short action ; ; 
the 
and , the medium action , and the 
, Af and the Magnums , the long action ( about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version ) . 
Previously , FN actions were used for the larger cartridges . 
High Standard has introduced a 
auto , the Sport-King , in two grades -- field and special ( less than $45 and just over $45 , respectively ) . 
It's a streamlined rifle , fast and well-made . 
Among 
Magnum Rim-Fire rifles , 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ) . 
Previously known as Jefferson Arms , Kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design , and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle 
Magnum rim-fires . 
Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings . 
The Model 99 ( under $45 ) is a light-weight , streamlined 
rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles . 
It's extremely accurate for an auto , and the test rifle I tried was completely trouble-free in functioning . 
The 989 ( about $40 ) is an even newer 
auto , this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip . 
Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared , but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination . 
The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which , surprisingly , gives pretty fair accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long . 
You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with 
shotshells -- to break the little Targo clay targets . 
A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets . 
A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available . 
You can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater , the 340TR ( about $40 ) or a single-shot , the 320TR ( $10 less ) . 
The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice , but it's tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds . 
They'll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark . 
The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds , right now ! ! 
Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961 , with the addition of the and to the list of Model 725's . 
These are made on special order only , in Kodiak grade ( about $310 ) , with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads ; ; 
they weigh around nine pounds . 
A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961 . 
This carbine ( under $140 , about $15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's Model 760 pump with a short-barrel . 
This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard . 
Presently , the 742C is available in Af . 
The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 Deluxe ( under $135 ) , which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design . 
The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate . 
Beginners' guns , '61 
A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961 , and they're good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to get for a youngster . 
The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 ( about $20 , $5 for a saddle scabbard ) -- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western look . 
Because of its traditional lines , it probably has more kid appeal than any other model . 
The action is a drop-block , handling all the standard 
rim-fires . 
Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning shooter , although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock . 
This is the Model 122 ( about $20 ) ; ; 
it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety -- i.e. , the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot . 
Stock design is excellent , and this model is a good first gun . 
Another boy's model is the 
single-shot Remington 514C ( around $20 ) , which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short -- 12-1/2-inch -- stock ; ; 
it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2 . 
A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year . 
The single-barrel Stevens 940Y ( under $35 ) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily . 
This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or gauge . 
There's another addition to the Stevens line , the pump-action Model 77 in ( under $75 ) , which you may or may not consider a kid's gun ; ; 
many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too . 
Shotguns , '61 
Although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year , a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market . 
For example , a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under , the Broadway ( from $350 up , depending on grade ) , differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end , a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting . 
The Colt line now includes a new scattergun , the Standard or Custom Pump Model ( about $90 and $150 , respectively ) in 12 , 16 and 20 . 
Firearms International has introduced another import , this one from Finland . 
It's the Valmet ( about $170 ) , a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices . 
High Standard has also added two models to its line . 
The Supermatic Trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto . 
The Flite-King Trophy ( beginning at just over $85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16 . 
Either model is a very good dollar value . 
Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is the Model 500 ( from $73.50 ) ; ; 
this is an improved version of the old Model 200 , a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun . 
See page 24 for a complete report on it . 
Handguns , '61 
Aside from the 
Jet -- which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two biggest developments -- few significant innovations appeared among 1961's handguns . 
Livery stable -- J. Vernon , prop. '' . 
Coaching had declined considerably by 1905 , but the sign was still there , near the old Wells Fargo building in San Francisco , creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years . 
John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered , but he could not retire from horsedom . 
Coaching was in his blood . 
He had two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving . 
Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the Santa Cruz road , upland and through the redwood forest , with orchards below him at one hand , and glimpses of the Pacific at the other . 
The journey back he made along the coast road , traveling hell-for-leather , every lantern of the tallyho ablaze . 
The southward route was the classic run in California , and the most fashionable . 
His patronage on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans -- regulars , most of them , and trenchermen like himself . 
They did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ) , nor of the tariff , which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco . 
Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel , luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest , and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa Cruz . 
Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring , so halts were contrived between meals . 
Then the Chinese hostler , who rode with Vernon on the box , would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon , sandwiches , pickled eggs , and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp . 
In spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine . 
They gathered roots , bulbs , odd ferns , leaves , and bits of resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir , which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains . 
In the Spanish days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense . 
It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar . 
Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips , but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks , and he was glad when the trips dropped off , and the botanists began to motor out by themselves . 
My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run . 
This was an honor , like dining with a captain at his private table . 
Vernon's office adjoined the stable , and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs , the folk art of the period . 
They advertised harness polish , liniments , Ball's Rubber Boots , Green River Whiskey , Hood's Sarsaparilla , patent medicines , shoe blacking , and chewing tobacco . 
The hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove ; ; 
then a porter from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head . 
It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters . 
Vernon was consummately fond of oysters , and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil War . 
Oyster salt roast -- oysters on the half shell , cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served -- was a standby at Manning's . 
Its early morning patrons were coachmen , who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy . 
In the 1890's the Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager , John C. Kirkpatrick . 
This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans , though the Palace chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters . 
( Gastronomes have long argued about which came first , the Palace's or Antoine's . 
Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding . 
The Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional . 
) Vernon , however , held out for plain oyster roast , and plenty of it , unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt , though he did fancy a bit of lemon . 
After the meal , he and his guests went out to inspect the rig ; ; 
this was merely a ritual , to please all hands concerned . 
The tallyho had cost Vernon $2,300 . 
A replica of two coaches made in England for the Belmont Club in the East , and matchless west of the Rockies , it was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run . 
One could shave in the reflection of its French-polished panels , and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels . 
The horses were groomed to a high gloss ; ; 
departing , they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw , for they had been trained to drag at important funerals . 
But for the start of the Santa Cruz run , the whip fell . 
The clients boarded the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven . 
They had been fed a hunting breakfast , so called because a kedgeree , the dish identified with fox hunting , was on the bill . 
There are many ways of making a kedgeree , every one of which is right . 
Here is an original kedgeree recipe from the Family Club's kitchen : 
Club Kedgeree 
Flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock , mix with a cupful of cooked rice , two minced hard-boiled eggs , some buttery white sauce done with cream , cayenne , pepper , salt , a pinch of curry , a tablespoonful of minced onion fried , and a bit of anchovy . 
Heat and serve hot on toast . 
The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast , the Palace's chef , was even more in demand . 
For decades it was the most popular dish served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast , and it is one of the few old Palace dishes that still survive . 
Native California oysters , salty and piquant , as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece , went into it . 
The original formula goes thus : 
omelet Arbogast 
Fry in butter a small minced onion , rub with a tablespoonful of flour , add half a cup of cream , six beaten eggs , pepper , celery salt , a teaspoonful of minced chives , a dash of cayenne , and a pinch of nutmeg . 
A jigger of dry Sherry follows , and as the mixture stiffens , in go a hundred of the little oysters . 
Louis Sherry once stayed a fortnight at the Palace , and he was so pleased with omelet Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York J. Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco , to attend an Episcopal convention , and brought the restaurateur with him . 
As things happened , Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill residence of a magnate friend , whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent . 
Sherry remained in his hotel suite , where he amused himself as best he could . 
Twice he left everything to his entourage , and fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance . 
In the grand court of the Palace , notable for its tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , Vernon's station was at the entrance . 
It was a post of honor , held inviolate for him ; ; 
he had the primacy among the coachmen . 
Of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late General Winfield Scott , who was said to be the most imposing general of his century , if not of all centuries . 
Vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly . 
Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho . 
He had style : he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked Epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them . 
They cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin . 
The road maps of the region have changed since 1905 ; ; 
inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names . 
Once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing . 
An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke . 
Vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar . 
The horses moved at a clump ; ; 
they were no more on parade than was their driver ; ; 
one fork of the road was as good as another . 
The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the Santa Clara valley below at the left . 
The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery . 
You arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh . 
Vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage . 
A number of them must have fallen into disfavor ; ; 
they were struck out with remarks in red ink , denouncing both the cooks and the management . 
He was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat . 
The horses seemed to know these by instinct , he used to say : such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins . 
There was Wright's , for one , lost amongst trees , its wide verandas strewn with rockers . 
Many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet , and lived there to the end of their days . 
It was the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce , who admired its redwoods . 
Acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to Berkshires ) , whose `` carcass sweepstakes '' were renowned . 
Their ham butts , cured in oak-log smoke , were also esteemed when roasted or boiled , and served with this original sauce : 
Wright's devil sauce 
; ; 
put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy , or of the boiled ham liquor , with a half stick of butter , three teaspoonfuls of made mustard , and two mashed garlic cloves . 
Contribute also an onion , a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins , and a mashed lime . 
After this has simmered an hour , add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire , catsup , and chutney , two pickled walnuts , and a pint of Sherry . 
Then simmer fifteen minutes longer . 
Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar , so that when its turn came , it was properly mellowed . 
Vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright's , and deer were rather a nuisance ; ; 
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers . 
But no one complained when they wound up , regardless of season , in venison pies . 
No one complained of the white wine either : at this altitude of two thousand feet , grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint . 
( The Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height . 
) Apple trees grew there also . 
Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring , the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle . 
Dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery , which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets . 
The merit of the pie , Vernon believed , was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven . 
The recipe , which he got from the baker , and wrote down in his ledger , is basically this : 
Wright's apple pie 
; ; 
peel , core , and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin , and set aside . 
In a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them , an equal amount of sugar , a sliced lemon , a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam , a pinch each of clove and nutmeg , and a large bay leaf . 
Let this boil gently for twenty minutes , then strain . 
Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes , drain them , and cool . 
Set the apples in the pastry-lined tin , spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter , with as much brown sugar , a sprinkling of nutmeg , and a fresh bay leaf , then lay on a cover of pastry , and gild it with beaten yolk of egg . 
Those who have never traveled the width and length of this land cannot conceive , on the basis of textbook description alone , the overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one government . 
The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the Midwest ; ; 
the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains ; ; 
the smoke-filled , art-filled , drama-filled life of the great cities of the East ; ; 
the lush and historic charm of the South .

Be careful here not to overexpose this subject since they are extremely bright and light-reflecting . 
In color , 1/50th of a second between Af and Af will do for bright , frontal sunlight . 
The South 
the southern United States , extending from Florida in the east to Texas in the west , still maintains its unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance . 
It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural beauty encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation , on the one hand , to places where entertainment and spectacles of all sorts have been provided for the tourist with camera . 
Of special interest this anniversary year of the war between the states are the many Civil War battlefields where , likely as not , you'll catch some memorial re-enactments .

Picturing the south 
Foliage is the outstanding photo subject in many of the Southern locales mentioned above and some specific tips on how and where to shoot it are in order . 
For example , the Chamber of Commerce of Gatlinburg , Tennessee , sponsors special camera tours into the Great Smoky Mountains to get pictures of the profusion of wild flowers flourishing in these wooded regions . 
Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas where uneven lighting results from shafts of sunlight filtering through the overhead branches . 
Best solution is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight or shade . 
In any instance , you should determine the exposure according to the type of light which falls on most of the subject area . 
Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide a welcome contrast with the many long-view scenics you'll be making . 
For shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum Southern mansions make sure your equipment includes a tripod .

The Midwest 
A pleasant start to your midwestern vacation is a few days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago . 
Lake Michigan offers swimming and pictures which combine cityscapes with beaches . 
A visit to Chicago's museums and a stroll around broad Michigan Avenue will unfold many photogenic subjects to the alert photographer . 
Wisconsin Dells , where fantastically scenic rocks carved by the Wisconsin River are overgrown with fern and other foliage , rates a stopover when traveling from Chicago . 
The farmlands forming the heart of America stretch out across the Midwest from Chicago . 
In North Dakota the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you to translate its wonder on to film . 
While here , visit Theodore Roosevelt National Park for its spectacular scenery . 
Another spot with an image-provoking name is the Black Hills where you can visit the old frontier mining town of Deadwood . 
The Black Hills Passion Play is produced every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting . 
Of course , while in this vicinity you won't want to miss a visit to Mount Rushmore National Memorial where on the side of a mountain are the famous sculptures of Presidents Washington , Lincoln , Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt . 
In Missouri ( which we are including in our general Midwest region ) you can glance into Mark Twain's birthplace at Hannibal , see the landmarks of his life and writings and visualize where Huck Finn hatched his boyish mischief .

There's a museum here and also Old Abilene Town , a reconstruction of the cattle boomtown of the 70's and 80's . 
For a resort area , Mackinack Island , Michigan , is the place to visit . 
It truly relives another age for the inhabitants use carriages rather than autos and old British and French forts are left intact for tourists to visit and record . 
Pictures of the Midwest 
Night scenes will add an exciting touch to your vacation travelogue and what better place to take them then along Chicago's Lake Shore Drive ? ? 
Just after sunset is a good time to record the city lights in color since you get a `` fill-in '' light from the sky . 
Another memo for sightseers : bring your camera along to museums . 
Photos of historic dioramas of the area you visit will add depth and background to your vacation photo story . 
Again , be sure your tripod is handy for those sometimes-necessary time exposures .

The West 
A western vacation is practically synonymous with a visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks in this area . 
A tour of several of them is possible in a two-week vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty spots can be of equal reward . 
In California is located one of the most popular of the national parks -- Yosemite . 
Among its most spectacular features are its falls , the highest being Upper Yosemite which drops 2,425 feet . 
The Sequoia Grove presents another unique aspect of Yosemite , for these ancient giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten . 
In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park . 
Fantastic colors are to be seen in the fanciful formations of eroded rock which loom out of the semiarid country in both parks . 
Colorado's Grand Canyon , probably the most famous landmark of the United States , can be the highpoint of your Western vacation . 
Built upon seven hills , Istanbul , like Rome , is one of the most ancient cities in the world , filled with splendor and contrast . 
It is an exotic place , so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses . 
At the moment , many of these are being pulled down . 
Whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques , the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn . 
Even when they are finished , however , the contrast will remain , for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents . 
For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets . 
Founded in the Ninth Century B.C. it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas , ruler of the Megarians , expanded the settlement and named it after himself . 
About a thousand years after that , when the Roman Empire was divided , it became capital of the Eastern section . 
On May 11,330 , A.D. , , its name was changed again , this time to Constantinople after its emperor , Constantine . 
In 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman power fell to the Turks , the city officially shifted religions -- although the Patriarch , or Pope , of the Orthodox Church continued to live there , and still does -- and became the capital of the Ottoman Empire . 
When that was broken up after the First World War , its name was changed once more . 
Rich in Christian and Moslem art , Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the center of town . 
Easy to get to , and becoming more popular every year , it is only fourteen hours from New York by Pan American World Airways jet , four hours from Rome . 
Start of tour 
Most of the sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern hotels . 
I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government Tourist Office , next to Pan American's office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel . 
From there I turned left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left , Republic Gardens , and came in a few moments to Taksim Square , one of the hubs of the city , with the Monument of the Republic , erected in 1928 , in its center . 
Directly across from the Gardens I found a bus stop sign for T 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus , with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately after that . 
There the bus turned right along the Bosphorus , past ocean liners at anchor , to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn , a brown sweep of water that empties into the Bosphorus . 
Across the bridge on the left I saw St. Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque . 
On the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square , with Yeni Cami , or the New Mosque , which dates from the Seventeenth Century , just across from the entrance to the bridge . 
Passing it , the bus climbed a hill , with the covered spice bazaar on the right and Pandelli's , a famous and excellent restaurant , above it . 
At the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park . 
I got off there , crossed the street , walked ahead with St. Sophia on my left , the Blue Mosque on my right , and in a moment came to the entrance of St. Sophia . 
Erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous St. Sophias , the first of which was begun by Constantine , this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later . 
On his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem . 
A few years later the dome fell in . 
Nevertheless , it remained one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire , where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned . 
After the Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque , adding the stubby minarets . 
In the second half of the Sixteenth Century , Sinan , the great architect who is the Michelangelo of the East , designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome . 
With the birth of the Turkish Republic after the First World War , St. Sophia became a museum , and the ancient mosaics , which were plastered over by the Moslems , whose religion forbids pictures in holy places , have been restored . 
Inside over the first door I saw one of these , which shows Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering the temple . 
On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing . 
The eight green columns , I learned , came from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus , the others , red , from the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis . 
Beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned , a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence . 
Behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork , where the emperors and , after them , the sultans , sat . 
Directly opposite is the emperor's door , through which they entered the building . 
Outside St. Sophia I walked through the flower garden in front of it , with the Blue Mosque ahead on my left . 
Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome , now a park . 
It was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games . 
Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen , mostly by the waves of Crusaders . 
At the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain , an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome , built in 1895 by the German Emperor , and on my left , directly across from it , the tomb of Sultan Ahmet , who constructed the Blue Mosque , more properly known by his name . 
Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed the street , entered the Hippodrome , and walked ahead to the Obelisk of Theodosius , originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B.C. by Thutmose , who also built those now in New York , London and Rome at the Lateran . 
This one was set up here in 390 A.D. on a pedestal , the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome , done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them . 
Beyond it I noted a small green column , about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the Serpentine Column , three entwined serpents , which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi , Greece . 
Near the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column , a truncated obelisk of blocks , all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes . 
Magnificent Mosque 
Retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet , only one with six minarets , I entered the courtyard , with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle . 
One of the most beautiful buildings in Istanbul , it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth Century , with a huge central dome , two half domes that seem to cascade down from it , and smaller full domes around the gallery . 
The round minarets , tall and graceful , rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer . 
Inside , the walls are covered with blue and white tile , the floor with red and cream carpets . 
Back at the Kaiser's Fountain , I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the Column of Constantine , also known as the Burnt Column , at the top on my right . 
It stands in the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine , who brought it from Rome . 
I stayed on the car for a few minutes until , turning right , it entered a huge square , Bayezit , with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it . 
There I got off , crossed the square , and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant , hard to come by in this part of the city . 
Called the Marmara Gazinosu , it is on the third floor , with signs pointing the way there , and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara . 
After lunch , in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet , flaky cake -- in Istanbul . 
It's a great favorite of the university students , and I joined them there for dessert . 
Taking the streetcar back to Kaiser's Fountain , I walked ahead , then left down the street opposite St. Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small , one-story building with a red-tile roof , which is the entrance to the Sunken Palace . 
Actually an underground cistern , its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars , it was built by Justinian in the Sixth Century to supply the palace with water . 
There is still water in it . 
I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately . 
Outside I walked past the entrance to St. Sophia , turned left at the end of it , and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead . 
Just before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an Oriental pagoda , with Arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet . 
Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall , I entered the grounds of Topkapi Palace , home of the Sultans and nerve center of the vast Ottoman Empire , and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance , past the Church of St. Irene , completed by Constantine in 330 A.D. on my left , and then , just outside the second gate , I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right -- the Executioner's Spring , where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims . 
Passing through the gate , with towers on either side once used as prisons , I entered a huge square surrounded by buildings , and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds , with explanations in English for each building . 
There are a good many of them . 
At one time about 10,000 people lived there . 
Following arrowed signs , I veered right toward the former kitchens , complete with chimneys , which now house one of the world's greatest collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services . 
Next to it is a copper section , with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate , floor-length robe . 
In the court once more , I went right toward the Reception House , a long one-story building with a deep portico . 
Going through a door into another small court , I had the Throne Room directly in front . 
I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the Treasury , which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds , jewelled swords , rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds , on which the sultans sat cross-legged . 
They are made of gold and covered with emeralds , pearls and other jewels . 
Taking the path behind the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it , the Portrait Gallery , I went right at the end of it , through a garden to a small building at the back -- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans , its floor covered with carpets , its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs . 
( Do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals . 
Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot , and to stop flames that arise from melting grease . 
Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat . 
Don't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces . 
Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent , rinse thoroughly . 
Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit . 
Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables , sauces and such . 
Don't fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops . 
Sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results . 
Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them . 
If doubtful about a steak , boldly cut it in half . 
If necessary to replace both halves on grill , sear cuts and allot extra time . 
For roasts , insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone . 
Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals . 
Don't practice a new recipe on guests . 
Have a test-run on the family first , to be sure timing and seasoning are right . 
Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it . 
Keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking , and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator . 
Don't plan meals that are too complicated . 
Limit yourself to good meat and drink , with bread , salad , corn or potatoes as accessories . 
Keep the desserts simple ; ; 
fruit does nicely . 
Do whatever kitchen work , such as fixing a salad , preparing garlic bread , or making a marinade sauce , ahead of time . 
When you start the outdoor performance , you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen . 
( This goes for getting a drink tray ready , and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins . 
) 
Don't think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world . 
The simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef . 
You need tongs to handle meat ; ; 
long forks for turning potatoes and corn ; ; 
heavy foil on hand at all times . 
And lots of hot pads ! ! 
Do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up , flames cannot reach the meat . 
Don't forget to have a supply of Melamine plates , bowls , cups , saucers , and platters for outdoor use . 
Made of the world's toughest unbreakable plastic , Melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors . 
There is even one set that has `` barbecue '' written on it . 
Do without fancy tablecloths . 
It's cheaper to buy Wall-Tex and cover your outdoor table . 
Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues . 
Oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best . 
Tougher than plastic , it wears well . 
Don't forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler , which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard , is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments . 
There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes . 
With them , you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures , and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders , to the marina or picnic , in A-1 condition . 
Do use paper napkins ; ; 
lots of them . 
Except when you prepare `` do it yourself '' shish kebob or a lobster roast . 
Then you'll want terry cloth towels for mopping up . 
Don't think barbecue cooking is just sometimes , or seasonal . 
It's year-round , and everywhere . 
In the winter , hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace . 
Even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter , inside . 
Summertime supper , outside , is a natural . 
You'll find , once your technique is perfected , that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-O-Matic . 
Do buy all-purpose mugs or cups . 
Get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot . 
Be sure to get a few more than you need . 
You will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one , use six for drinks , serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen -- and need one more to mix the salad dressing . 
Don't forget the joys of a meal on the road . 
If you travel over the vast U.S.A. you will , no doubt , discover that feeding is an expensive business . 
Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work . 
You can take it with you . 
A picnic bag , a grill , a cooler for soft drinks and beer , and for frozen convenience foods . 
Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings ; ; 
or just evenings . 
Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas ( gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and -- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up , hamburger , buns , an array of relishes , and fresh fruit -- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant , and 100% more fun . 
You need a little stove , a coffee pot and a stew pot ; ; 
maybe a skillet , a basket of essentials like salt , pepper , plates , forks , knives and a can opener . 
As you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night , visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal . 
For 25-cents load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car . 
Simple meat dishes 
spice is a fact of life in the U.S.A. . 
You only have to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean . 
Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat , salami , Vienna sausages , mettwurst , bratwurst , bockwurst , knackwurst , Bologna , pepperoni , blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties . 
Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes , a bit of green pepper , a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook , and a meal a feast . 
Sure , for the most of us , a frankfurter is the favorite . 
A story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St. Louis , around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers . 
So that his customers should not soil their hands , Feuchtwanger issued white gloves . 
Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise . 
He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks . 
Years later , franks-in-buns were accepted as the `` first to go '' at the New York Polo Grounds . 
The nation's number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or , more sedately , charcoal broiled on a portable grill . 
Either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation . 
To make the picnic frank come close to perfection , remember these tips : 
-- Score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through . 
This permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking . 
-- Relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns . 
Bring along the conventional ones -- catsup , pickle relish , mustard , mayonnaise -- plus a few extras , such as tangy barbecue sauce , chive cream cheese , or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd . 
-- Using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns , too . 
Watch closely while browning them , as it doesn't take long . 
-- An unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey , lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic . 
Broil or toast as usual . 
Contrary to popular opinion , `` a la mode '' doesn't mean `` with ice cream '' -- it just means , in the latest style . 
Here are a couple of the latest , highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard ! ! 
You'll have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering ! ! 
Jiffy barbecues 
1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped , spiced ham 6 sandwich buns , heated 
. 
Combine first 4 ingredients in saucepan ; ; 
heat thoroughly . 
Add ham ; ;

Serve on buns . 
Makes 6 barbecues . 
Hot hibachi franks 
You'll never hear `` sayonara '' , the Japanese word for goodbye , from your guests when you give a hibachi party . 
The fun of toasting their own sausages over the small Oriental charcoal burners and dipping them in tasty sauces will keep your group busy -- try it and see ! ! 
Canned cocktail frankfurters 
sweet-sour sauce 
1 large onion , chopped fine 2 tablespoons salad oil 1 8-oz. can crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of the juice 1/4 cup brown sugar 2 tablespoons vinegar 1 tablespoon prepared mustard 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce pineapple chunks 
. 
Mustard cream 
2 tablespoons dry mustard Water 1/2 cup heavy cream , whipped Salt Paprika 
. 
Spear canned cocktail franks with picks . 
Also spear pineapple chunks and place in separate bowl . 
Make sauces ahead . 
Sweet-sour sauce can be kept warm over a second hibachi or chafing dish while charcoal in broiler is reaching glowing coal stage . 
Mustard cream , used as alternate dip for franks and pineapple tidbits , tastes best when served at room temperature . 
For sweet-sour sauce , cook onion in oil until soft . 
Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil . 
Simmer about 10 minutes , and keep warm for serving . 
To prepare mustard cream , blend mustard with enough water to make a thin paste . 
Fold into whipped cream and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika . 
Trim-your-own-franks 
A back-yard picnic with grilled frankfurters and a selection of frankfurter trimmings is a fine way to entertain guests this summer . 
Be sure to have plenty of frankfurters and buns on hand . 
Some tasty frank toppings are chili con carne , Coney Island sauce and savory sauerkraut . 
Serve the chili and kraut hot with the franks . 
Here are suggestions for the frankfurter trimmings : 1 . 
Chili con carne : use canned chili con carne . 
2 . 
Coney Island sauce : finely chop several onions and add enough catsup to moisten well ; ;

Note : 
Directions are written for those who have had previous experience in making pottery . 
Instructions for preparing clay , drying , glazing and firing are not given . 
Equipment : 
Basic pottery studio equipment . 
Wooden butter molds and cookie presses . 
Materials : 
Ceramic modeling clay : red , white or buff . 
Stoneware clay for tiles . 
Glazes , one-stroke ceramic colors , stains , cones as indicated in the individual instructions . 
General directions : 
Use well-wedged clay , free of air bubbles and pliable enough to bend without cracking . 
Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly ; ; 
they must be free of oil , wax and dust . 
Pressing designs : 
The size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed . 
Roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions . 
Whenever possible , use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay . 
When mold has more than one design cavity , make individual paper patterns . 
Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects ; ; 
experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ) . 
Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold . 
To obtain clear impression of mold , press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity , starting at center and working to outer edges . 
Trim excess clay away from outer edges . 
Check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay . 
Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles . 
Allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique , do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ) . 
To release clay from mold , place hands in a cupped position around project ; ; 
gently lift the edge on far side , then continue to release edge completely around mold . 
Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay , but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold . 
Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat , clay and mold in one action . 
This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending , causing warping when fired . 
Place project on table and carefully lift the mold off . 
Study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections . 
If clay is slightly out of shape , square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides , or smooth round pieces with damp fingers . 
If the background of design is too smooth , or you wish to create a wood-grained effect , it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush . 
Make slight , smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ) . 
Leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly , covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping .

score other side of D and one side of disk E and join as before . 
While assembled lid is still on design head , gently but firmly press it on plaster board . 
If design head has a deep cavity , clay lid will be quite thick at this point ; ; 
press eraser of pencil gently 1/4'' '' deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying and firing . 
Check fit of lid on jar ; ; 
if inner lid is too big , trim to fit , allowing room for thickness of glaze . 
Remove lid from head of mold .

Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat . 
Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view . 
Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom , bunks for three , galley and marine toilet . 
The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit . 
All are well distributed , not crowded together near the stern . 
And with passenger weight shifted forward , Hotei levels off for speed under power of a Merc 800 . 
The 80-hp motor drives her at 25 mph with six aboard ! ! 
With only two aboard , Hotei does better than 27 mph -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop . 
She also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser . 
Nor is she a wet boat . 
We've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry . 
A lot of thought went into storage space construction . 
There's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items . 
The cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis , life jackets , etc. . 
The aft cockpit has a Af storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat . 
On each side of the motor well there's storage for battery , bumpers , line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below . 
The well itself is designed to take two Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it . 
Needless to say , you can't build Hotei in a couple of weeks . 
Our building time was slightly over 400 hours -- but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom , sink , head and hardware was under $800 . 
A comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3,000 . 
Consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3,000 and your building time is well worth it . 
A Gator trailer , Model 565 , is used to transport the boat to the waterways . 
This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years . 
All framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which , in the dressed state you buy it , is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings . 
Therefore , the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens , etc. , on a table saw . 
Besides flathead bronze screws , silicon bronze Stronghold nails ( made by Independent Nail & Packing Co. , Bridgewater , Mass. ) are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints . 
Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings . 
Start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor . 
Draw each outline in a different-color chalk , one on top of the other . 
In this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes . 
The transom frame is made first with the joints lapped , glued and fastened with one-inch , No. 12 Stronghold nails . 
After notching it for the keelson , chines and battens , the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails . 
All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint , again using the one-inch , No. 12 nails . 
The frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines . 
If notched for the battens , they would require more work , be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through . 
Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking . 
The jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete . 
This is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction . 
Be sure all members are parallel , vertical and level as required . 
After the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced , a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson . 
The frames are glued and screwed to this piece . 
The joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed . 
It is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced . 
The keelson , made of two three-inch widths , is next installed . 
The first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two . 
The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first . 
Note , however , that it is six inches shorter at the forward end . 
One-inch , No. 10 screws are used in both cases . 
A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one . 
The stem is laminated from four pieces . 
Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four . 
Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig . 
The first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames . 
The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member . 
They're glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson . 
A number of C clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets . 
All bottom battens are two inches wide . 
The side ones are a half-inch narrower . 
The battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames . 
Glue and 1-1/2-inch , No. 10 screws are used . 
Placement is important because the rear seat , bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens . 
With the exception of two battens , all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling . 
The chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending . 
Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple jig . 
I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips . 
The aluminum , flush against the battens , acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily . 
If you don't own a planer and don't want to buy one , it's well worth renting . 
The planking is five-ply , 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood . 
This can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long . 
The 42-inch width leaves very little waste . 
Four pieces are used . 
Plank the sides first , using glue and one-inch , No. 12 Stronghold nails at all battens , the stem and the transom . 
Another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening . 
The best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off . 
Then trim the excess . 
I used a Homemaster Routo-Jig made by Porter Cable for this job . 
It's good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high rpm and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw . 
When cut , the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming . 
Then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom , frames , keelson and all the battens . 
It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings . 
The next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points . 
Then it is replaced and fastened . 
The bottom planking is applied in the same manner . 
After planking , the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas . 
The spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws . 
Then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation . 
Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails , they are also rough-sanded in that area . 
The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time . 
A 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches . 
Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size . 
Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin . 
When the resin has hardened , mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish . 
I used bright red , mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener . 
Using a cheap brush , coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth . 
When the cloth is smooth , apply another coat of resin , spreading it with a paint roller . 
Be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden . 
When the whole bottom has hardened , use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail . 
Then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem . 
Before the resin has hardened , screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline . 
This protects the bottom in beaching . 
Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co. , 1605 W. Elizabeth Ave. , Linden , N. J. . 
They will also supply literature on application . 
The hull is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level , well-braced position . 
I set it on the Gator trailer . 
I laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem , also installing a bow eye at this time . 
For added strength , I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint . 
Again , these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed . 
After trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height , the top of the side planking is installed . 
This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom . 
These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry . 
When they're on , the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten . 
The sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom , forming a real strong transom brace . 
Note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces . 
The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood . 
All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood . 
Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring . 
The exception is where the flooring butts . 
These battens are glued and screwed to the frames . 
With all deck battens in place , the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line . 
Use one coat of Firzite and one coat of marine paint . 
Bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place . 
After the decking is on , the cabin sides are installed . 
They're followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated . 
The windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin . 
Inside , bunks are framed up and installed as indicated . 
A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the port bunk . 
The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink . 
For padding the seats and bunks , I used Ensolite , Type Aj . 
Lightweight , non-absorbent , fire resistant and dimensionally stable , it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement . 
Available in Af sheets , it costs about a dollar a square foot . 
You can build this vacation cottage yourself . 
It is a full scale , small , but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail . 
Because of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski , you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time . 
Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials , and requires the use of only simple tools . 
On the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage , from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim . 
In recognition of the growing trend for second homes , or vacation cottages , we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind . 
It is a big project , not to be taken lightly . 
But each step has been broken down into easy stages , utilizing standard materials and simple tools , well within the capabilities of the handyman . 
The theory 
The idea behind our design is modular units , or panelization . 
Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials . 
Wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors , making for a minimum of cutting . 
We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop , panel by panel , according to plan . 
Thus , when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor , these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend . 
The roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days . 
Then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure . 
A warning 
Due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country , the first thing to do is to find out what , if any , they are . 
Close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used ; ; 
in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all . 
This can usually be found out at the nearest town hall . 
At the same time check the electrical , plumbing , and sanitary requirements , as well as possible zoning regulations . 
Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not , check the local customs in the use of bottled or L-P gas ( we give you alternatives later on ) . 
Be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion . 
If there are any major restrictions , they usually can be obtained in printed form . 
Where a building permit is required , find out what you must present when applying for one . 
In many cases , you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector . 
These will be available at cost from our Plans Department . 
The site 
Some general things to look for in a site , if you haven't already bought one , are accessibility , water drainage , and orientation . 
How are the roads , and how will they stand up ? ? 
Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property ; ; 
swampy areas or intermittent springs ? ? 
A visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative . 
Note where the sun rises and sets , and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from . 
Will the view be something you can live with ? ? 
Don't worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain ; ; 
we will take up alternative foundations later on . 
The materials 
With this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( AjA version ) and the expandable ( AjB version ) . 
This will be for the shell of the house only ( roof , walls , and floor ) , and does not include the carport or balcony . 
This will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost . 
Bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions , fancy flooring , appliances and fixtures , electrical wiring , and plumbing , all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues . 
The wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard Af and Af of a good grade , free from structural faults . 
They should be as straight as possible , as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected . 
The outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood , plastic coated panel board , high density particle board , asbestos-cement board , or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer . 
The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof , and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired . 
All panel board comes in standard Af foot size . 
It is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame . 
The fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound . 
The louvers are constructed as shown in the detail , with a drop door for ventilation . 
There are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them . 
The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade . 
The filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full Af sheets as shown , leaving no wastage . 
The battens covering the joints are of Af stock and are applied after the walls are erected . 
All nails should be rustproof , and aluminum is highly recommended . 
Note : If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out , or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other , and 1/8-inch glass is used , stock lumber in Af , Af , and Af can be used in making the glass panels . 
Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim . 
In any case , there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels . 
With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools , fixtures , and attachments available , the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool . 
The drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck , a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted , a head in which the quill is mounted , a feed lever which moves the quill up or down , a power source , and a movable table upon which the work is placed . 
There is often a means of locking the quill and , on larger presses , the table can be tilted . 
The size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column . 
A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle . 
A new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle . 
The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work . 
Set-up and maintenance 
The drill press should be leveled and , depending on whether it is a bench or floor model , bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws . 
This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy . 
A coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table ; ; 
wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill . 
Presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill . 
The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush . 
Be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease . 
Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount . 
Keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by hand ; ; 
excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings . 
Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position . 
The return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ) , loosening the lock nut or screw , and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved . 
Turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension , counter-clockwise will increase it . 
Don't lose the chuck key 
. 
Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key ; ; 
otherwise , you'll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use . 
Feeds and speeds 
Drill speeds are important if you want a good job . 
Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed , depending on the material worked . 
On most drill presses , it is impossible to get the exact speed , but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys . 
You will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool . 
See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds . 
Generally , the larger the tool and the harder the material , the slower the speed . 
Feed pressure is also of major importance . 
Too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools . 
Too light a feed , particularly with metal or other hard material , causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge . 
The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate . 
Common drilling tools 
There are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes . 
The most common are the twist drill , the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades , the double spur bit , and the power wood bit . 
All will do a good job if sharp , but the twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others , since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts . 
The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade . 
Since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced , they should be used at the slowest speed available , and fed very slowly to avoid binding . 
Fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool , so if you want to avoid nicked fingers , keep your hands well out of the way . 
Simple hole drilling operations 
When drilling all the way through a workpiece , always place a piece of scrap wood underneath . 
This will not only protect the work table , but also assure a clean breakthrough . 
Another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through , then drill half way with the dimensional bit , turn the piece over , and finish from the other side . 
In soft woods with pronounced grain , there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander , due to the varying hardness of the wood . 
In this case , drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy . 
When a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth , mark the depth on the side of the stock , then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark . 
The depth gauge rod can now be set , and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth . 
The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects . 
For their length , their types of construction , their picturesque settings , and their literary associations , they should be known and remembered . 
In this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection . 
The first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part , -- and perhaps the most interesting one , connected Newbury ( now Newburyport ) with Salisbury Point . 
Its building was first proposed in 1791 , when a group of citizens , mostly Newburyport men , petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation . 
This document began : `` No. 1 Newbury Port , may 30th , 1791 
`` Whereas , a Bridge over Merrimack River , from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf , Esquire , in Newbery , to Deer Island , and from said Island to Salisbury , would be of very extensive utility , by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages , Teams and Travellers at all seasons of the year , and at all Times of Tide . 
`` We , the Subscribers , do agree , that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this , or a similar Writing , We will present a petition to the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge , and a Right to demand a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge , and on like Terms , and if such an Act shall be obtained , then we severally agree each with the others , that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names , the whole into two hundred shares being divided , and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times and in such Manners , as by the said proposed Corporation , shall be directed and required '' . 
This paper was signed by forty-five persons , subscribing a total of two hundred shares . 
A month later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built . 
The matter was considered and reconsidered , and finally opposed , but in spite of many objections , the Court granted a charter on January 9 , 1792 . 
On November 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened . 
Timothy Palmer , who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges , was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex , or `` Deer Island '' bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of William Coombs , who received $300 as recompense . 
This two-part bridge is best described by Rev. Timothy Dwight , president of Yale College , in his `` Travels In New-England And New-York '' , published in New Haven in 1821 . 
He says of it : 
`` It consists of two divisions , separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore . 
The division between the island and this shore , consists principally of an arch ; ; 
whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet , and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark . 
In appearance and construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge . 
The whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four . 
I have already mentioned that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country . 
As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only , and had never seen a structure of this nature ; ; 
he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention '' . 
It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby Rowley ; ; 
that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was sixteen years old ; ; 
and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect , Moody Spofford . 
It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch , which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth , Haverhill , and Philadelphia . 
The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was not covered . 
As far as we know , no American bridge had been thus protected in 1792 . 
Richard S. Allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810 . 
Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the `` Massachusetts Magazine '' in May 1793 , which is reproduced herewith ( Fig. 1 ) . 
A brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber . 
Between the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet ; ; 
between the north shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long . 
A dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place July 4 , 1793 , in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island . 
It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter , who was one of the first share-holders , stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion . 
The `` Essex Journal '' says that he `` delivered an oration on the bridge , which for elegance of style , propriety of speech or force of argument , was truly Ciceronian '' . 
The reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek , because Dexter's oration could hardly be understood ; ; 
and , although he later explained that he was talking French , it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening . 
The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction , although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning . 
It stood in its original form until 1882 . 
The southern half , however , on account of its underbracing , was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation . 
In 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge . 
This was built by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette County , Pennsylvania . 
Timothy Palmer had general supervision of the work . 
An advertisement in the `` Newburyport Herald '' , December 21 , 1810 , shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges . 
It reads : `` chain bridges 
`` . 
Information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport , Mass. has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge , in the states of Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Vermont , Rhode Island , and Connecticut , so far as relates to the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges . 
`` Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site , and lay out and superintend the work , or recommend a suitable person to execute it . 
John Templeman 
`` Approved , Timothy Palmer '' 
. 
This chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end . 
It fell , February 6 , 1827 , carrying with it a horse and wagon , two men and four oxen . 
The horse and men were saved , but the oxen drowned . 
In spite of this catastrophe , the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on July 17 , 1827 . 
This second chain bridge was 570 feet long , had two thirty-foot towers and a draw , and a double roadway . 
The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868 , when the County Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack bridges as highways . 
Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use , the old covered , wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site , May 28th to June 3rd . 
Colonel Frederick W. Lander , impersonated , will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's ( now College ) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel Benjamin F. Kelley's ( West ) Virginia Infantry , then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates . 
He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction ; ; 
that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s . 
The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements , war , fire , and floods , as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic , for more than a hundred years . 
Twice during the Civil War it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister . 
It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on U.S. Route 250 -- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike . 
It is one of the very few , if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U.S. highway system , thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days . 
This covered , wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of June 3 , 1861 , and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story . 
So frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in West Virginia . 
Completed and opened for traffic in 1852 , the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth and his brother , Eli , of Beverly . 
The Chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders , and against the competition of other , and better known , bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered , wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike a dozen years before , as well as many other bridges for several counties . 
The Philippi bridge , however , was the Chenoweth master piece , with its 139-foot , dual lane , span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders . 
Never rebuilt , the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers , a concrete floor , and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic . 
During the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior . 
Union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather , and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams . 
But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when Brigadier General William E. ( Grumble ) Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-Imboden raid in May , 1863 . 
General Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings , including the long bridge at Fairmont , and , after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge , he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it . 
Reverend Joshual Corder , a Baptist minister , gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies , to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure ; ; 
he reasoned and argued , pointing out that Jones or other Confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat . 
Jones relented , he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley , via Beverly , and across the mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army , while Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden . 
Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned to destroy it , after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered , certainly not because of pressure from an opposing Confederate force . 
On the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose . 
Centering around this historic old structure , a group of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events , beginning on May 28th and continuing through June 3rd , to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi . 
It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening , vigorous , rigorous , not wholly unrewarding years . 
We have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here , a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there . 
We have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy . 
We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds . 
True , our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools , thereby diluting our spectacular attractions . 
But problems cling to pools , as any pool owner knows . 
So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials , errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience . 
Where to put it 
Position may not be everything , but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties , social and/or physical . 
We speak from varying viewpoints . 
One of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house . 
The other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill . 
If you are dreaming of a blue , shimmering pool right outside your living room windows , close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children , damp towels , squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys . 
You are likely to be nearer the truth . 
You can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters , the greater the chance for violation of family privacy , annoying noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-club attitude . 
On the other hand , out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool . 
Another dilemma : As picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be , trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool . 
Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed . 
As in choosing a wife , it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good . 
In the colder climes , for instance , you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best . 
It may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay , or an ice floe studded with logs . 
Even a neat , plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold . 
( We do , however , recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool . 
) 
Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts . 
Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land . 
But if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day , it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house . 
And a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods , but good hard pavement . 
The placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety . 
Coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet . 
Eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master's delectation . 
But not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies . 
We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards . 
Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled . 
Had we taken a lien on a state park ? ? 
Not at all . 
We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks . 
We were in business ! ! 
From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks . 
Naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool '' were both unexpected and unsettling . 
Our book of etiquette 
After the first few weeks , it was obvious that rules had to be made , laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result . 
So rules we made , in unabashed collusion . 
Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely , we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners . 
First and foremost : No one -- no , not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle . 
Just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view . 
Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool , but on our terms and at our times . 
No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand . 
No ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees . 
We want to know when the Potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won't end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August . 
No young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party . 
And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities . 
A gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard . 
No bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run . 
( Sanity , solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop . 
) 
We designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours . 
This has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young `` less fortunate '' than ours . 
We also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille . 
We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides . 
All dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers' homes . 
( To avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house , it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool , and the parking area . 
) We do , however , provide a limited number of extra suits , mainly for children , and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences . 
Life-preservers , the buckle-on kapok-filled kind , are held in readiness , too , for the very young . 
Preserving life and limb 
Safety rules , of course , are more important than all the others put together . 
In many localities , now , the law requires all pools to be fenced , usually to a minimum height of 5 feet . 
But fenced or unfenced , no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay . 
We allow no underwater endurance contests , either , or inexpert versions of water polo . 
Diving boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly , but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ) . 
And divers must be enjoined to look before they leap , either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge . 
Our pools also have wide , shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords . 
All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups . 
When you first acquire a pool , we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent . 
You should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits . 
Soignee pools , alas , do not just happen . 
They are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements . 
Unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity , its care and feeding -- from pH content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service . 
Of course , if your pool is close to the house , your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ) . 
Or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers . 
Even so , every pool owner , in case of emergency , should have some idea of what makes things work . 
A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis . 
Preserving the pool 
A sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight . 
You need more chlorine . 
The walls feel slippery . 
You need algaecide . 
With or without professional help , you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse . 
You should see to it that the trap , the dirt-catcher in front of the filter , is always clean . 
A pool is no place for a shut trap . 
You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water . 
When shed , they leave rust marks . 
You can hope against hope that come spring cleaning , your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing . 
It has happened . 
Many hours of spring cleaning will be saved , however , if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall . 
As the pool is emptied , stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet . 
Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp , but requires dynamite if allowed to dry . 
If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe , you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out . 
Of course , when your 6-inch torrent of water is released , it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties . 
Do not forget this possibility . 
If your pool is located on or near sloping ground , it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris . 
It may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene , but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around . 
Once on the water , these little visitors seldom leave , and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present . 
Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense . 
Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible , from pipes to brushes . 
Follow pool-care instructions to the letter , and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job , with no chance for claiming , `` It wasn't my turn '' . 
Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship . 
You may find yourself hitting bottom , literally , as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in . 
Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania . 
Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years . 
Fortunately , it is the FHA which has arrived at this conclusion , for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage , and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress . 
Even if you live above that line , the FHA will back you , for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged . 
New simplified packaged units , recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts , and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900 . 
Two men can often do the installation in a day . 
You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house . 
Its upkeep ? ? 
No less an authority than the FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs . 
Is it worth-while ? ? 
Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted . 
We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable , and accurate controls assure the comfort we want . 
We know , too , that health is never harmed by summer cooling . 
On the contrary , there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills . 
The filtered air benefits allergies , asthma , sinus , hay fever . 
Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid . 
Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat . 
Housekeeping is easier . 
The cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum , fewer trips to the dry cleaners , lighter loads for the washing machine . 
The need for reupholstering , redecorating , repainting becomes more infrequent . 
Clothes hold their shape better , and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words . 
It will improve your disposition . 
When you're less fatigued , things just naturally look brighter . 
The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals , and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms . 
You'll sleep longer and better , too , awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves . 
You can forget about screens , and leave the storm windows up all year around . 
Best of all , central air conditioning is something you can afford . 
Like its long-lived cousin , the refrigerator , a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more . 
That brings its per-year cost down mighty low . 
For any house . 
No matter what style your home is , ranch , two-story , Colonial or contemporary , central air conditioning is easily installed . 
The equipment won't take up valuable space either . 
It can go in out-of-the-way waste space . 
But there's no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning is when you build . 
If that's done , the house can be designed and oriented for best operation , and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself . 
If you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building , by all means make provision for its easy adding later . 
Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances , and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial . 
If your house is to have a forced warm air system , cooling can be a part of it . 
This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system , for your regular heating ductwork , filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling . 
You can get year-'round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy , horizontal or counterflow . 
The units can be installed in basement , attic , crawlspace , or in a closet located in the living area . 
The cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet . 
From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard , garage , carport , or basement . 
If you plan to add cooling later to your heating system , there are things to watch for . 
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed . 
They may be inaccessible later . 
Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling . 
This is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone . 
Be sure you get a perimeter heating system , and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating . 
You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house . 
For cooling , chilled water is circulated instead of hot water . 
Instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating units , each with its own thermostat . 
These systems are more expensive than year-'round forced air systems . 
The minimum cost for an average one-story , 7-room house with basement , is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone . 
Separate systems . 
If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty , it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system . 
The simplest kind of separate system uses a single , self-contained unit . 
It is , in effect , an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled , cleaned , dehumidified air where it is wanted . 
In a long , rambling ranch , two such units can be installed , one serving the living area , the other the sleeping zone . 
In a two-story house , one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor , another in the attic to cool the second . 
In each case , having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control . 
The heat pump . 
One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating . 
As you know , a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors . 
A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward , and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors . 
Up until recently , this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees . 
Now , the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees . 
You can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone . 
Consider it as a standby setup , at negligible cost , for those emergencies when the furnace quits , a blizzard holds up fuel delivery , or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole heating plant . 
What size conditioner ? ? 
How large a cooling unit you need , and the method of its installation , depends on a variety of factors . 
Among other things , besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside , it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family . 
Families with children usually don't want the house quite so cool . 
If you are a party thrower , you may need added capacity . 
The body is a heat machine , and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load . 
Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of Aj . 
A BTU is a unit of heat , and the BTU rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour . 
A very rough rule of thumb is that , under favorable conditions , you'll need 15 BTU's of cooling for every square foot of your house . 
This is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees . 
You'll need more if the high average is above that , less if it's below . 
Coolers are also rated by tons . 
A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice . 
By accepted definition , a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12,000 BTU of cooling in one hour . 
You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower . 
It is generally an inaccurate method of rating , for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor , and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll get . 
A 1-hp conditioner , for example , may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 BTU to well over 10,000 Aj . 
The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need , rather than trying to do this yourself . 
Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough . 
Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big . 
Here's why : 
Reducing humidity is often as important as cooling . 
An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly , then shut down for a long period . 
Before it cycles on again , humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low . 
With a unit of the right size , a compressor will run continuously during hot weather , reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature . 
Money-saving tips . 
Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately . 
A well-designed , 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year , or $11 a month . 
If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily , your unit will have less heat to remove . 
Keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won the first battle . 
In a new house , generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution . 
If the house you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs , you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises , fences and awnings . 
Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can . 
Drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house . 
The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact . 
The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need . 
A shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money . 
You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation . 
Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house . 
They're easier to shade there . 
An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool . 
You'll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one . 
Gas adds to the moisture load . 
Insulate , weatherstrip , double-glaze to the maximum . 
In insulation , the numbers to remember are 6-4-2 . 
They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling , 4 inches in the side walls , 2 inches in the floors . 
Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation , but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling . 
A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent . 
It costs two to three times as much to remove a BTU in summer as it does to add one in winter , so every solitary BTU is worth attention . 
You'll foil them in droves , along with their pal humidity , by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan , a bathroom ventilator for when you shower , and an outside vent for the clothes drier . 
Keeping conditioners quiet . 
It's no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet , but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum . 
Good workmanship is important in the installation , so if you're doing your own contracting , don't award the job on the basis of price alone . 
Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom . 
Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning . 
This is particularly true in site selection . 
You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; ; 
you must have a list of requirements on where , how many , and what type sites are needed . 
With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available . 
Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible . 
These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies . 
The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site . 
These are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological Society , Washington 25 , D. C. . 
In recent years many counties and the U. S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use . 
Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office showing ownerships of land . 
Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation . 
This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions , the exposure to the sun and wind , the water interests , etcetera , which vary greatly with the seasons . 
It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field , showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site . 
These are a great aid for planning use back at the office . 
For site planning work , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study . 
However , there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation . 
County judges , commissioners , engineers , assessors , and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences . 
A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area . 
How much study is required ? ? 
This , of course , depends on the character of the site itself , the previous experience of the investigator , and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision . 
It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone . 
Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions . 
A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water . 
The same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use . 
In looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements , you need information to compare the site with others . 
You need answers to four important questions . 
What are the existing recreation features ? ? 
How well can the site be developed ? ? 
How useful will it be to the public ? ? 
Is this site available ? ? 
Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site . 
Naturally , a park site with scenic views , a good lake , trees , and sand dunes , will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes . 
Quality is vitally important . 
Frontage on a body of clear , clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water . 
Some recreation features , such as scenic values and water interest , also have greater overall value than other interests . 
One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery . 
It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake , colorful rock formations , or unusual trees . 
A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic . 
An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach . 
A site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs . 
Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy . 
Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site . 
Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas . 
This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean , stream , or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing , fishing , boating , and other water sports . 
A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use . 
It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life . 
The amount of water frontage , the quantity and quality of the water , and the recreation afforded by it are important . 
A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use . 
The quantity of water flow may be critical ; ; 
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer . 
If the site is on a reservoir , the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied . 
Check the quality of the water . 
A stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area . 
Other factors , such as water temperature , depth of water , the fish life it supports , wave action , flooding , etcetera , will affect its recreation value . 
Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests , canyons , mountains , deserts , seacoast , beaches , sand dunes , waterfalls , springs , etcetera with which the area is blessed . 
Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance , counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area . 
Although the site may not contain the features themselves , there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site . 
The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them . 
A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site . 
The fish , animals , and birds which may be found at the site are another interest . 
Fishing interest calls for a check of the species found , quantity and size , the season they are available , and the stocking program of the fish commission . 
Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas . 
The site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life . 
Clams , crabs , and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas . 
Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done . 
Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in . 
The historical sign tells its story , but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered . 
Notice should be taken of unusual rock formations , deposits , or shapes of the earth's crust in your region . 
Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites . 
An old shipwreck , a high dam , an old covered bridge , a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold , etcetera may be of interest . 
Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas , caves , artifacts , etcetera . 
How well can the site be developed ? ? 
Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use , what can be done to correct the faults , and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites . 
Many things need to be checked : 
size and shape 
-- The size of the area alone can be a determining factor . 
An area may be too small for the needs of the project . 
Areas should be large enough to include the attractions , have ample space for the use of facilities needed , and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments . 
Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones . 
Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development . 
A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide . 
This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions . 
However , a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments , or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail , or include scenic strips within the park unit . 
Adjoining areas 
-- The values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands , ownership and use of the land , and the utilities available there . 
For instance , a site adjoining other publicly owned lands , such as a national forest or a public road , may be desirable , whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not . 
The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site . 
Topography 
-- Topography is very important . 
Check the elevation of the ground , degree and direction of slopes , drainage , rock outcrops , topsoil types and quality , as well as subsoil . 
Nearly level areas are required for parking areas , beaches , camp areas , ballfields , etcetera . 
Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be . 
Water 
-- In addition to its recreation interests , water is needed for drinking , sanitation , and irrigation . 
The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection . 
The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines . 
Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas . 
Plants 
-- The existing plant growth calls for thorough checking . 
Look at the trees as to size and interest , the amount of shade they provide , how healthy they are , the problems of maintenance , fire hazards , wind throw , etcetera . 
An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up . 
Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value , other areas of brush may need to be cleared . 
The extent and location of open areas is noted . 
Exposure 
-- How much will wind , rain , sun , and temperature affect the use ? ? 
An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use . 
The direction , velocity , and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area . 
Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable . 
Sometimes , you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade , morning sun , or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended . 
Improvements 
-- Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings , roads , utilities , cleared land , etcetera which may raise the cost of the site . 
Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; ; 
and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . 
The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician . 
These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 , era . 
Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was , indeed , brilliant . 
Prokofieff's Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties . 
To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; ; 
to the Neo-Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world . 
What was it to Prokofieff ? ? 
A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas ; ; 
a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; ; 
a brilliant piece de resistance ? ? 
Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon . 
I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 . 
All musical Paris was there . 
Some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical . 
I myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) . 
I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? ? 
The answer is , `` Yes '' ! ! 
Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure . 
His life-long friend , Serge Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New York , and Washington , D.C. , , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . 
Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love For Three Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto . 
`` Uncle Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden Twenties '' . 
We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; ; 
we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches ; ; 
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . 
We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers . 
Nevertheless , Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World -- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America -- the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff , Stravinsky , Koussevitzky , Cocteau , Picasso -- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art -- the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms . 
So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; ; 
in the spacious hunting grounds of `` Uncle Sam '' ; ; 
in the exciting salons of his lovely , brilliant Paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone , color , dance , design , and thought . 
Meanwhile , three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing . 
In this world-wide conscription of men , minds , and machines , Prokofieff was recalled to his native land . 
The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty , and the outraged , freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission . 
After this holocaust , a changing world occupied the minds of men ; ; 
a world beset with new boundaries , new treaties and governments , new goals and methods , and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure . 
In this changed world , Prokofieff settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose . 
Here , this happy , roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world . 
Here , Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism -- producing music for the masses . 
It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges . 
One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer , especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous . 
But no : Prokofieff grew . 
He accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise . 
By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : `` I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom , but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody . 
This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new , not old '' . 
How right he was ; ; 
how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism . 
And with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music . 
Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth Symphony ; ; 
or the Love For Three Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet , The Stone Flower . 
This masterpiece has gaiety , too , but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy , salty and humorous . 
Of course , these works are not comparable , even though the same brain conceived them . 
The early works were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience ; ; 
the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens . 
However , in all of Prokofieff's music , young or mature , we find his profile -- his `` signature '' -- his craftsman's attitude . 
Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se . 
In orchestration , he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color . 
His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable . 
His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle . 
His counterpoint is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick . 
Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations , the brilliant orchestrations , the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass , the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output , even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound was required . 
That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original '' than we prefer to believe . 
Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability . 
Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero , who , by the force of his creative life , helped preserve the main stream of tradition , to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated . 
At this date , it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History , as an effective Traditionalist , who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation , and used it as it served his purpose ; ; 
yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics . 
Certainly , it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World -- not his experimentations . 
So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them . 
Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances . 
His fellow-countryman , Igor Stravinsky , certainly did not . 
Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity , while Stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness ? ? 
I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words : `` the clarity must be new , not old '' . 
When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of `` lucid , straightforward music , so difficult to compose '' , he shaped his talents to his purpose . 
When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures , many salons , many dialectics , many personalities , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles , determined by many disparate cultures . 
Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas . 
But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting . 
In all his miscalculations , Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations -- representing many peoples , time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony , melody , or form , to verify his own experiments . 
Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials , and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre Du Printemps , his incisive Les Noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed . 
But time is running out , and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma . 
His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself : Supra-Expressionism , Neo-Paganism , Neo-Classicism , Neo-Romanticism , Neo-Jazz , Neo-Ecclesiasticism , Neo-Popularism , and most recently , Post-Serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ! ! 
What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ! ! 
Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; ; 
a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem ( The Star-Spangled Banner ) ; ; 
a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; ; 
a circus polka for elephants ; ; 
his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ! ! 
Stravinsky , nearing the age of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird , flitting from one abandoned nest to another , searching for a home . 
How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded . 
Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction . 
In the process , his native endowments were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose . 
With a large and circumspect 20th-Century technique , he wove the materials of national heroes and events , national folklore and children's fairy tales -- Slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well , and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large . 
Of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat , Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; ; 
time and economic security ; ; 
symphony orchestras , opera and ballet companies ; ; 
choruses , chamber music ensembles ; ; 
soloists ; ; 
recordings ; ; 
broadcastings ; ; 
television ; ; 
large and eager audiences . 
It must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive : economic security and cultural opportunities , incisive idioms , social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose . 
Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century . 
That his moods , even in his early years , are those of his people , does him honor , as his music honors those who inspired it . 
That he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments , is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; ; 
and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-Century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution , based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music . 
April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States . 
On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund , organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash , observed its 30th anniversary . 
Roy Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century , especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman . 
And like this English master , Mason realizes his subjects in large , simplified masses which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them . 
As a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors , its tang of weather , its change of seasons , its variable moods . 
His father , a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter , took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions , and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature . 
Out of this background of hunting and fishing , it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field , fishermen in the stream , ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape . 
It is this subject matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen , but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors . 
Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting . 
Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours in a struggling family business which , though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures . 
But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial art , and later , for twelve years , he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia . 
On the death of their father , they returned to their home in Batavia , New York . 
After more years of concentrated effort , Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand . 
During all this time Roy continued to paint , first only on weekends , and then , as the family business permitted , for longer periods . 
Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether , and for the past thirty years , he has worked independently as a painter , except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions . 
But even on these , the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ! ! 
Except for a rich friendship with the painter , Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons , though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- Roy developed his art by himself . 
In the best tradition , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy and assurance , and then to paint . 
He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor , and his first public recognition and early honors , including his election to the Academy , were for his essays in the heavier medium . 
Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique . 
It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason on numerous occasions , mostly in the vicinity of Batavia . 
More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting . 
What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration , integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form ; ; 
color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; ; 
and that over-all , amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark . 
Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done . 
Inspiring -- yes ; ; 
instructive -- maybe ; ; 
duplicable -- no ! ! 
But for the technical fact , we have the artist's own testimony : 
`` Of late years , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors . 
First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately Af inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light , the middle tone , and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns . 
If a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture , I try to place them in the initial sketch . 
For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose . 
`` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; ; 
as a result , such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him . 
Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting , unless the position serves the design of the whole composition . 
If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design , often only slightly , finer pictures would result . 
Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees , logs , and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position , which I call clicking . 
`` Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness , but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution , he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition . 
`` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition , I mean to project equal concern for color . 
Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere , a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat . 
When this occurs , I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field . 
`` When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal . 
When this linear draft is completed , I dust it down to a faint image . 
From this point , I paint in as direct a manner as possible , by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage . 
However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described . 
Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first , the range of values , the accenting of minor details -- all in all , mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness . 
The longer I work , the more I am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method is important . 
Trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting . 
`` As for materials , I use the best available . 
I work on a watercolor easel in the field , and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain . 
In my studio I work at a tilt-top table , but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes . 
I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers , but prefer an English make , rough surface , in 400-pound weight . 
After selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins ' on its surface ) , I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean , cold water . 
Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board . 
`` In addition to the usual tools , I make constant use of cleansing tissue , not only to wipe my brushes , but to mop up certain areas , to soften edges , and to open up lights in dark washes . 
The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist . 
I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio . 
`` My brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists , for I combine the sable and the bristle . 
The red sables are 8 ; ; 
two riggers , 6 and 10 ; ; 
and a very large , flat wash brush . 
The bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge . 
`` My usual palette consists of top-quality colors : alizarin crimson , orange , raw sienna , raw umber , burnt sienna , sepia , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , French ultramarine blue , Winsor green , Hooker's green 2 , cadmium yellow pale , yellow ochre , Payne's gray , charcoal gray , Davy's gray , and ivory black '' . 
In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason , the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness , yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here . 
True , a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory . 
Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention , this artist's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate . 
Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; ; 
a middle distance often containing the major motif ; ; 
and a background , usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky . 
In following this general principle , Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background , and the illusion of depth is instantly created . 
When painting , Mason's physical eyes are half-closed , while his mind's eye is wide open , and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey . 
He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; ; 
rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory , his imagination , his nostalgia . 
It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment . 
His pictures generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale ; ; 
they universalize in terms of weather , skies , earth , and people . 
By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way , Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art . 
Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor , a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all . 
The artist was born in Gilbert Mills , New York , in 1886 , and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California , he lived in western New York , in Batavia . 
When I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15th , I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 thru March 20 ) . 
And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes , and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again , in his natal month of March ! ! 
Over the years , beginning in 1929 , Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; ; 
two Ranger Fund purchase awards ; ; 
the Joseph Pennell Memorial Medal ; ; 
two American Watercolor Society prizes ; ; 
the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor , Art Institute of Chicago ; ; 
and others in Buffalo , New York , Chautauqua , New Haven , Rochester , Rockport , and most recently , the $300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach Art Association , 
He was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship in 1940 . 
Other memberships include the American Watercolor Society , Philadelphia Water Color Club , Allied Artists of America , Audubon Artists , Baltimore Watercolor Society . 
The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason -- they were better . 
They were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers . 
Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance . 
The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics . 
But why gymnastics at all ? ? 
And is the sport really important ? ? 
After all , we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition . 
But if it is important , what can we do to improve ourselves ? ? 
It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem , for just as gymnastics can learn from dance , dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics . 
Taking first things first , let's understand the sport called gymnastics . 
It is made up of tumbling , which might be said to start with a somersault , run through such stunts as headstands , handstands , cartwheels , backbends , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work . 
The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms , but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games . 
The parallel bars , horse , buck , springboard , horizontal bar , rings , and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball , volleyball , basketball and football . 
But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance . 
The gymnast must develop strength , flexibility , coordination , timing , rhythm , courage , discipline , persistence and the desire for perfection . 
In short , gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well . 
The addition of endurance training later , when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury , provides that final quality that makes the top athlete , soldier or citizen . 
Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life . 
( An enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days . 
Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries . 
) In most sports , as in most walks of life , the angels are on the side of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him . 
The American is very lucky if he has three . 
If a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations , it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools . 
First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension , since action relieves both . 
Oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty . 
Certainly there would be less anxiety , fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ) , and higher scholastic averages , since alert children work better . 
Russia knows this , and that is why there were over 800,000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team . 
Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself . 
We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people . 
And what has dancing to do with all this ? ? 
A great deal . 
Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus . 
Well-stretched , trained in posture and coordinated movement , and wedded to rhythm , they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest . 
American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons . 
They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace . 
They were further stripped of old wive's tales by seeing the slender , lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle . 
President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation . 
If we wait until children are in junior high or high school , we will never manage it . 
To be fit , one has to start early with young children , and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance . 
If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible , we will be that much ahead . 
School teachers , all too unprepared for the job they must do , will need demonstrators . 
There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand , and also how to help other children learn it . 
They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught . 
Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work , but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility . 
Very little in today's living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility . 
Dancers do have flexibility . 
They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back , chest , shoulder and arm strength . 
Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results , considering the amount of physical training they have had , will be very disappointing . 
Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas . 
This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin themselves once , and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ) . 
The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw . 
The chinning bar 
For arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended . 
It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone , and a chair should be placed under it , a little to one side . 
Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it . 
Those who are too weak , should climb on the chair and , starting at the top of the chin , let themselves slowly down . 
When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent , they will have the strength to chin-up . 
Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home . 
The horse kick 
Arm , shoulder , chest , upper and lower back strength will be aided with the Horse kick . 
Start on hands and feet . 
Keeping the hands in the starting position , run in place to a quick rhythm . 
After this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms , kicking higher and higher . 
Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible . 
Push-ups 
Push-ups are essential , but few have the strength for them at first . 
Start on the knees in a large circle . 
Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor . 
Push back up and repeat . 
Do this exercise six times each class period . 
As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward . 
Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet , and , as strength improves , fall farther and farther out . 
Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands . 
The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide . 
Let the body down slowly , taking at least five seconds for the letting down . 
Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up . 
Handstands 
Handstands come after arms , chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength . 
Of course those who have developed more will find them easier . 
Start with the class standing in a circle , with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle . 
At first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help . 
Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back . 
The left will follow at once . 
The right will land first , followed by the left . 
Return to the standing position . 
Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible . 
This will prevent flat falls and toe injuries . 
Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper . 
Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg . 
The child should then bring both legs together overhead , point the toes and tighten the seat muscles . 
Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time . 
Backbends 
The backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics , and , as with all acrobatics , the sooner begun the better the results . 
Have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent . 
Place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears , fingers pointing toward the shoulders . 
Arch the back upwards to make a bridge . 
Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling . 
As flexibility improves , the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher . 
Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover . 
Back circle 
To further increase back flexibility , work on the back circle . 
Have the class lie prone . 
Place the hands in front of the chest . 
Keep the legs straight and the toes pointed . 
Straighten the arms slowly , this arches the back . 
At the peak of the arch , tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head . 
Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head . 
Somersaults 
The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the somersault , or forward roll . 
This used to be part of every child's bag of tricks , but few children can do it today ; ; 
some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright . 
For most small children , learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can . 
After it has been seen , have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin , inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) . 
He places the hands on either side of the head , keeping the chin down on the chest . 
He then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over . 
One or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo . 
If , however , the child is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help will be needed . 
When the child raises his seat into the air , the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis ; ; 
then no matter what happens , the child's performance will be controlled . 
By lifting the seat upwards a little , the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded . 
These are beginnings , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong , flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ) . 
Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal , the good tumbler will be a better dancer , a better athlete , and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity . 
It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative . 
And dancing school , so helpful in artistic and psychological development , also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more . 
Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics . 
We have noted how some electronic techniques , developed for the defense effort , have evenutally been used in commerce and industry . 
The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality . 
When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment , the prospect is staggering . 
The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that , in this area alone , the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities . 
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery . 
We use the term `` bio-medicine '' because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research . 
Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine , the electrocardiograph , and the diathermy machine . 
Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises , contusions , and simple bursitis . 
Commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction , along with radiation counters , timers , and similar devices . 
In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates . 
From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research . 
Ultraviolet microscopy 
Many cells , bacteria , and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation . 
This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside . 
A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-TV system to view the results . 
Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute . 
By combining the talents of a medical man , Dr. Aterman , a biophysicist , Mr. Berkely , and an electronics expert , Dr. Zworykin , this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes . 
Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources . 
These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; ; 
the specimen is magnified by the microscope . 
Instead of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the TV camera does the `` looking '' . 
The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum , which means that all lenses must be quartz . 
The video signal is amplified and then switched , in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength , corresponding to red , green , or blue , is seen . 
( Note : Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another , the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor . 
This assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry . 
) This is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-TV system which preceded the present simultaneous system . 
Three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube . 
The result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths . 
Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum . 
Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color . 
Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all , ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color TV picture reveal a wealth of detail . 
At the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it . 
Breathing -- electronically analyzed 
The medical title of `` Lobar Ventilation In Man '' by Drs. C. J. Martin and A. C. Young , covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process . 
At the University of Washington Medical School , the electronics group has developed the `` Respiratory Gas Analyzer '' shown in Fig. 3 . 
This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing . 
In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung , the total volume of inhalation per breath , the flow of air from both lobes , and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other . 
Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill , standing still , or in some other medically significant position . 
From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail . 
Heart-measuring techniques 
The original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat , but today's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta , dimensioning of the heart and its chambers , and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat . 
For many of these measurements the chest must be opened , but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed . 
A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques . 
One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube , filled with mercury , around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched . 
A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed . 
Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy . 
The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second ; ; 
thus it takes about 16 Msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue . 
A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation . 
In addition to the heart and aorta , successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique . 
The Doppler effect , using ultrasonic signals , can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel . 
A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself . 
It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream . 
The latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow . 
It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer , mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left ventricle , to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself . 
This pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made . 
A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2 . 
Outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge , followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder . 
From this doctors can read heart rate , change in diameter , pressure , and effective heart power . 
Radio-transmitter pills 
Several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers . 
This original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm. in diameter . 
Battery life limited the use of this `` pill '' to about 8 to 30 hours maximum . 
A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs. Zworykin and Farrar and Mr. Berkely of the Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute . 
In this novel arrangement the `` pill '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer . 
As shown in Fig. 4 , an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc. bursts . 
The energy received by the `` pill '' causes the resonant circuit to `` ring '' on after the burst and this `` ringing '' takes place at the resonant frequency of the `` pill '' . 
These frequencies are amplified and detected by the FM receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and , after the `` pill '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure indications can be obtained . 
One of the advantages of this method is that the `` pill '' can remain in the patient for several days , permitting observation under natural conditions . 
Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments . 
Sonar in medical research 
One of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body . 
Our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects . 
Various methods of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines , map ocean floors , and even communicate under water . 
In medicine the frequencies are much higher , transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques may be used , but the principles involved are the same as in sonar . 
Because the body contains so much liquid , transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels . 
Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals . 
Based on this phenomenon , a number of investigators have used this method to `` look through '' human organs . 
A good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr. G. Baum who has explored the human eye . 
He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma . 
The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig. 6 . 
The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath , not shown . 
For display , Dr. Baum uses a portion of an Af , an airborne radar indicator , and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record . 
A typical `` sonogram '' of a human eye , together with a description of the anatomical parts , is shown in Fig. 5 . 
The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter . 
The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan , just like a radar antenna , while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to `` look into '' all corners . 
The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period . 
Drs. Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results . 
By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck , as shown in Fig. 7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights . 
As mentioned before , bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center . 
Arteries and veins are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls . 
A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in Fig. 8 with the various parts labeled . 
Oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life . 
He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 14 , 1777 . 
His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family , let alone educate them in a town without even a school . 
The two older boys , Hans and Anders , his junior by a year , therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; ; 
his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish . 
Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg , the wigmaker , and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading , German , and Danish in the informal curriculum . 
Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned , such as the pastor , to supplement the simple teaching . 
From the town surveyor , Hans learned drawing and mathematics and , from a university student , some academic subjects . 
The mayor of the town taught them English and French . 
Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other ; ; 
they read every book that they could borrow in the village . 
At 12 , Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop , which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science . 
His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life . 
In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session . 
While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine , physics , and astronomy , his brother studied law . 
The brothers continued to help each other during their studies , sharing a joint purse , lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt . 
They supplemented their income by small government assistance , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could . 
So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; ; 
there is a struggle there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom of utterance there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society . 
I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty , gained a new truth , or banished a previous error '' . 
He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science . 
In this third year at the university , Hans , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token of recognition , a gold medal for his essay on `` Limits Of Poetry And Prose '' . 
He completed his training in pharmacy also , taking his degree with high honors in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine . 
He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices . 
Ferment of scientific activity 
Hans' student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France , Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent . 
The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university . 
He was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis . 
The following year he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany , France , and the Netherlands , meeting the philosophers Schelling , Fichte , and Tieck . 
He also met Count Rumford ( born Benjamin Thompson in Woburn , Mass. ) who was then serving the Elector of Bavaria , and the physicist Ritter ; ; 
these were Oersted's main contacts in science . 
From Gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days , he wrote , `` The first question asked everywhere is about galvanism . 
As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented , I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in Copenhagen I used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me '' . 
Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks , continuing their correspondence after he left . 
With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized mind . 
Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut De France for its annual prize of 3,000 francs . 
The sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him . 
In May , 1803 , Ritter , in another flight of fancy , wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy . 
He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries . 
Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention of the `` Leiden '' jar by Kleist , 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke , 1782 produced the condenser of Volta , and 1801 the voltaic pile . 
Ritter proceeded , `` You now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon . 
This we might well witness '' . 
Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it . 
In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist . 
However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals . 
In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University , though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817 . 
During Oersted's attendance at the university , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences . 
He was , however , fortunate in his contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey ( 1769-1842 ) , teacher of chemistry , who , in addition to his academic chair , was also proprietor of the `` Lion Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him . 
Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's disposal during and after his graduation . 
In 1800 , Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy . 
In February 1801 , Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead . 
In the following year , 1803 , Oersted , simultaneously with Davy , discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts . 
Eager as he was to pursue this promising line , he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to `` galvanizing '' . 
He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood . 
The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level . 
His broad interest in literary , political , and philosophical movements opened many doors to him . 
His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong . 
The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again , but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey . 
In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris , 1813 ) under the title Recherches Sur l'identite Des Forces chimiques et electriques , a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists . 
His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated . 
Chapter 8 , is entitled `` On Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces . 
The great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison . 
It is true , that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication ; ; 
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference . 
The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form . 
There , forces are more latent than in electricity , and less than in magnetism . 
But in such an important question , we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty , and not a thing which is contrary to it . 
One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat , which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature , just as electrical bodies do . 
It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature , as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb . 
By that , one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces . 
An attempt should be made to see if electricity , in its most latent stage , has any action on the magnet as such '' . 
His plan and intent were clearly charted . 
Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions . 
In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma , in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship . 
He continued as a popular lecturer . 
He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current . 
In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm , one of the Danish islands , being one of three scientists in the expedition . 
It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition , Lauritz Esmarch , that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow . 
Together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper , thereby producing stronger currents . 
Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery . 
Discovery of electromagnetism 
the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades . 
Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles . 
In the late 1700's Beccaria and Van Marum , among others , had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it . 
Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic . 
The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise . 
The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces . 
Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters , laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it . 
The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820 . 
At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle . 
Knowing specifically what the many feed additives can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef , dairy , and sheep men . 
The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what . 
All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government . 
All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with Aj . 
This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef , dairy cattle , and sheep are adequately balanced with protein , vitamins , and minerals . 
The drug's chemical name is listed , since most states require feed processors to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag . 
In some instances , the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name . 
This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on the feed tag .

There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle : ( 1 ) Fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons ; ; 
( 2 ) Mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot , are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ; 
( 3 ) Special bunks -- as discussed here , they permit cattle to eat from all sides . 
Feed is put in with an elevator . 
Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk . 
The selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation , cost of materials available locally , and your own preference . 
No one material is best for all situations . 
Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem . 
Fence-line feeding . 
Animals eat only from one side , so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk . 
These bunks also serve as a fence , so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence . 
Because of their location , on the edge of the feed lot , fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal . 
Filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations . 
All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year . 
This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall . 
Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs. . 
Why ? ? 
Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes , enlarged R & D facilities , faster new product development . 
Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling , distribution , and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge . 
Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs. ? ? 
Based on our experience with clients , , we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management . 
1 . 
Problems in the market 
greater price-consciousness . 
There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years ; ; 
there is every indication it will continue . 
Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers , distributors , and dealers . 
Despite generally good levels of income , we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer . 
Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : 
Has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning ? ? 
Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse ? ? 
Have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem ? ? 
Increased customer sophistication . 
Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims , partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions . 
This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses . 
Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ? ? 
Greater demand for services . 
Need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties . 
There are two reasons for this . 
First , most products tend to become more complex . 
Second , in a competitive market , the customer feels his weight and throws it around . 
Providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product . 
Too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction . 
Good service starts with product design and planning : Many products seem to be designed for a production economy , not for a service one . 
Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization , and your distributor organizations , not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations . 
Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention ? ? 
Wider discretionary choices for customers . 
In spending his money today , the consumer is pulled in many directions . 
To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely -- the implications are important . 
Your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products . 
Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products . 
Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole `` discretionary buying '' area ? ? 
Geographic shift of customers . 
The trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the Southwest and Far West , and from city to suburbs . 
These shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs. . 
Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation , strength of distributor organizations , and even plant location ? ? 
Market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts . 
We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends . 
Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts , there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts . 
The change may require different products , pricing , packaging , warehousing , salesmanship , advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted . 
Have you examined these trends , forecast the effects , and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances ? ? 
2 . 
Problems in marketing methods 
more private label competition . 
In the area of private label competition , it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade . 
As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size , there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits -- which is , in effect , what the sale of private brands tends to do . 
Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business , delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded . 
Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on . 
If you are up against private brand competition , have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position ? ? 
If private brand competition hasn't been felt in your product field as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ? ? 
Less personal salesmanship . 
Display merchandising , backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion , will continue to make strides in the sixties . 
It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program . 
How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important ? ? 
If you have a higher-quality product , how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word ? ? 
Salesmanship is still necessary , but it's a different brand of salesmanship . 
Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products ? ? 
Have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing ? ? 
Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers ? ? 
Higher costs of distribution generally . 
Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure , some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes . 
No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved . 
The use of bulk handling is continuously growing . 
Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels . 
`` Selective selling '' -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers . 
There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain . 
Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination ? ? 
In your sales force , will a smaller number of higher-priced , high-quality salesmen serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen ? ? 
Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share ? ? 
In one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men , the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos. . 
As a result , distribution costs were cut , customer relations improved . 
Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job . 
Higher costs of advertising and promotion . 
From the manufacturer's point of view , the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties . 
It is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods , and private label competition . 
How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program ? ? 
Are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers ? ? 
Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort , money , and effectiveness ? ? 
Increasing tempo of new product development . 
Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon . 
Will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products ? ? 
If competition beats you to it , this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store . 
On the other hand , the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive . 
As markets become larger and marketing more complex , the costs of an error become progressively larger . 
Is your R & D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ? ? 
Are there regular communications from the field , or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R & D people ? ? 
Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing , but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register . 
Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; ; 
who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; ; 
and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ? ? 
We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn't make up its mind . 
3 . 
Problems in marketing management 
shortage of skilled salesmen . 
There is a shortage of salesmen today . 
In the future , quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy , and the qualitative need will be greater still . 
While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel , much of it has been product rather than sales training . 
Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need . 
Most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements . 
Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively ) ? ? 
Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs. ? ? 
Shortage of sales management talent . 
With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition , sales management , whether at the district , region or headquarters level , is a tough job today -- and it will be tougher in the future . 
Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work . 
The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply , and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties . 
Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term ? ? 
Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people ? ? 
Complexity of complete marketing planning . 
Every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning . 
`` Hip-pocket '' tactics are going to be harder to apply . 
Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis . 
They have to be . 
With greater investments in plant facilities , with automation growing , you can't switch around , either in volume or in product design , as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically . 
Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company ? ? 
We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning . 
Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team ? ? 
Do you have a long-term ( 5- or 10-yr. ) marketing program ? ? 
The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company's marketing problems realistically . 
Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems , whether they be in the market , in marketing methods or in marketing management . 
If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke , then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade . 
The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion . 
The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that , therefore , the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building . 
Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables , workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter is education . 
It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses , some even have six or more . 
The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification , however , would demand a prolonged study of structure . 
This would , naturally , lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer's training . 
We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject . 
The real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training ? ? 
The American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course . 
An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design , for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art , and a further `` on the spot '' inspection of a number of schools , show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations . 
One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions . 
The suggested course of the A.I.D. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities . 
Obviously , the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated . 
Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer . 
To begin with , what is an interior designer ? ? 
`` The Dictionary Of Occupational Titles '' published by the U. S. Department of Labor describes him as follows : `` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors of houses , commercial and institutional structures , hotels , clubs , ships , theaters , as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television . 
Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture , floor coverings , wall decorations , and determines color schemes . 
Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval . 
Makes necessary purchases , places contracts , supervises construction , installation , finishing and placement of furniture , fixtures and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project '' . 
In addition to this the U. S. Civil Service Bureau , when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers , expects that `` when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them . 
He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings '' . 
This seems like a large order . 
The interior designer , then , must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance . 
Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it . 
And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society . 
Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum . 
It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise . 
The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations . 
Yet even here many a problem is presented ; ; 
as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- `` design a luxury apartment '' ; ; 
no description of the client or his cultural level , no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply `` a luxury apartment '' . 
Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design . 
It is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get `` the feel '' of real interior design demands . 
Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem is the rule . 
It is like medical schools in India where , in that fairy-land of religious inhibition , the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon . 
Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants . 
Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience . 
In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use . 
But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable . 
Consultation with architects , clients , real estate men , fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work . 
Fortunately , although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length , today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student , not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is `` in the trade '' . 
Even the `` history of furniture '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides . 
Here , too , the reality of actual furniture must be experienced . 
The professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers , National Society of Interior Designers , Home Fashions League and various trade associations , can and do aid greatly in this work . 
Certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations . 
Not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations , but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject . 
Participation for the educator in this case , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership . 
The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and , indeed , refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog . 
This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students . 
The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice . 
This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced , the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands . 
In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools . 
That is in the continuance of the `` grandfather clauses '' in their membership requirements . 
When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth . 
Long hard years of `` on the job '' training had brought them to their competence . 
The necessity of that day has long disappeared . 
There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today . 
It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand . 
The reason and the day of `` grandfather clauses '' has long since passed . 
No one can deny that these `` back door '' admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies . 
Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves . 
It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education , a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students . 
The local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications . 
Nor will the hack , the Jack-of-all-trades , still found in some of the smaller art schools , suffice . 
Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design . 
At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position `` must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art '' . 
This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer . 
We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education , experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres . 
Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture , furniture design , textiles and color is also desirable . 
In all `` degree '' courses in interior design a number of `` academic '' or `` general studies '' courses are included . 
It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English , history , psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art , especially interior design , as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects . 
The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed . 
The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account . 
One technical question of school organization comes to mind here . 
For proper accreditation of schools , teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate . 
Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed . 
Indeed , it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all . 
The question , however , cannot be ignored for long . 
The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree . 
Most professors in the course must , naturally , again have a higher degree than the course offers . 
One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute . 
It is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it . 
This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general . 
Only the independent art schools , that is , those not connected with any university or college , receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations . 
It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department . 
This , plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design , has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design . 
In spite of this , many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject . 
There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools , whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the `` National Association of Schools of Art '' . 
Independent art schools granting degrees must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group .

A program to fit your needs 
Consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program . 
Too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant . 
But even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product , there are other facts to consider . 
How old is your working force ? ? 
What's your profit margin ? ? 
In what section of the country are you located ? ? 
Are you in a rural or urban area ? ? 
These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program . 
Above all , don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will . 
Unions stress fringe benefits , but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time . 
Aim to balance your employee benefit package . 
Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere . 
They're asking for union trouble . 
Communications 
If you want credit for your employee services program , let your workers know what they're entitled to . 
Encourage them to exercise their benefits . 
This can be done by stories in your house organs , posters , special publications , letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command . 
Some companies find a little imagination helpful . 
Hallmark Cards , Inc. , Kansas City , Mo. , has a do-it-yourself quiz game called `` Benefit Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees . 
M & R Dietetic Laboratories , Inc. , Columbus , gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe . 
U. S. Rubber Company , New York , passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits . 
The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package , for example , costs $227.72 . 
Insurance 
Have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically . 
You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions . 
Check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you . 
Use deductable insurance wherever feasible . 
It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates . 
Also , beware of open-end policies , especially in the medical field . 
This will mean that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner . 
Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits . 
Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death . 
Generally , your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement . 
Special time off 
In granting bereavement leaves , specify the maximum time off and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify . 
Thus , you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's funeral . 
Also , reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it . 
Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated . 
Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time . 
If coffee is sold at the cafeteria , let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group . 
Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas . 
Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers , if you are supplying the coffee . 
Otherwise , you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers . 
Retirement policies 
Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company . 
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age . 
Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan . 
Younger men usually don't think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're liable to change jobs several times before settling down . 
Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans . 
There are two sides of a coin for this decision . 
Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to . 
And they can at least collect the money they put in , plus interest , when they leave the company . 
A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires . 
Thus , there is an added incentive to stay on the job . 
Holidays 
Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working . 
These include : leaves of absences , illnesses , and layoffs . 
Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant . 
It's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods . 
For example , the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday . 
This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups . 
Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay . 
This cuts the absentee rate . 
Eating facilities 
Consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias . 
Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices , and at a profit to you . 
If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria , keep an eye out for quality and price . 
If the soup tastes like dishwater , your employees won't blame the concessionaire . 
You'll take the rap . 
Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's convenient for most employees . 
You may save valuable production minutes with a change . 
Vacations 
Spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks . 
This will cut the expense of vacation replacements . 
And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates . 
Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation . 
You might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year . 
The long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era . 
Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition . 
The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away . 
But with all the changes in philosophy , dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant , including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports , hunting and fishing . 
As the generations move on , clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports . 
Sporting firearms change , markedly for the better . 
Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon , the demand of today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment . 
The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders , extremely accurate bolt , lever , and slide action firearms . 
And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition , designed for today's hunting and target shooting . 
And due to modern resource-use and game management practices , there is still game to shoot , even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water . 
Present conservation practices regard wildlife , not as an expendable natural resource , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped . 
Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states , on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year . 
Close to two million game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting preserves , and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season . 
The shooting development program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines , many national weeklies and the trade papers . 
The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves . 
This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New York staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 . 
Following the kick-off of SAAMI's shooting development program in 1954 , a most interesting meeting took place in Washington , D.C. . 
The group known as the American Association for Health , , Physical Education , and Recreation ( a division of the National Education Association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the National Rifle Association , SAAMI and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers . 
This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project . 
The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact , so often overlooked , that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life . 
The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school , and they are important to proper physical development . 
But with the exception of professional athletes , few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman . 
Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by OEP director Dr. Julian Smith , today thousands of secondary schools , colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs . 
SAAMI's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education . 
Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops , at which hundreds of school administrators , teachers , professors , and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education . 
Considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths , the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach . 
In 1959 SAAMI's shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports . 
This program is now nationally known as `` Teen Hunter Clubs '' . 
Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation . 
The first program was sponsored by Abraham & Strauss , Hempstead , New York , under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis . 
Other pilot programs were conducted by A & S , Babylon , New York ; ; 
J. L. Hudson , Detroit ; ; 
Joseph Horne , Pittsburgh . 
Other THC activities followed , conducted by shopping centers , department stores , recreation equipment dealers , radio-TV stations , newspapers , and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources . 
SAAMI's field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic young Americans . 
Through the efforts of SAAMI's shooting development program these shooting activities , and many others , including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks , trap and skeet leagues , rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted , to mention only a few . 
The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand . 
While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders too often forget it . 
Help is needed from dealers , at the grass-roots level . 
The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association . 
Since SAAMI's conception in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954 , millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults . 
We trust that you , as a gun and ammunition dealer , have benefited through additional sales of equipment . 
Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports ? ? 
Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition ? ? 
Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons ? ? 
Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs , shooting programs , and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves ? ? 
Ask Sammy Shooter . 
We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates , seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's famed Outer Banks . 
This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use . 
With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now . 
There were umbrella tents , wall tents , cottage tents , station wagon tents , pup tents , Pop tents , Baker tents , tents with exterior frames , camper trailers , travel trailers , and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps . 
Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves , lanterns , coolers , bedding , games , fishing tackle , windbreaks and sunshades . 
We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long National Seashore Recreation Area . 
Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often , look at the equipment and talk with the campers . 
Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry . 
Camping is big and getting bigger . 
No one knows where it will stop . 
Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets . 
You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping . 
The number depends on who is talking at the moment . 
The figures range as high as 15 million families . 
I've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping . 
Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more . 
Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable . 
More campers than campsites 
Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with . 
They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space , but families are being turned away , especially on holiday weekends . 
The National Parks , always popular camping places , are facing the same pressure . 
The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present . 
The U.S. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily . 
But the campers still come . 
They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding . 
They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits . 
They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance . 
Why they keep coming 
There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds . 
Among them , according to the U.S. Department of Commerce , are : ( 1 ) shorter work weeks , ( 2 ) higher pay , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations , ( 4 ) better transportation , ( 5 ) earlier retirement , and ( 6 ) more education . 
The more people learn about their country , the more they want to learn . 
Camping is family fun , and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before . 
But make no mistake about it , the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy . 
Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford . 
The American Automobile Association , computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile , comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29 . 
The AAA then splits it down this way : $10.50 for meals , $9.50 for lodging , $7 for gas and oil , and $2 for tips and miscellaneous . 
What does the camping couple do to this set of figures ? ? 
The $9.50 for lodging they save . 
Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of the tip money . 
The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way . 
Where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer , they now think about how many vacations they can have . 
Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year . 
And even if they stay in resorts part of the time , they might , if the right salesman gets them in tow , develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces . 
It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts of home . 
They're not . 
Home is the place to find the comforts of home . 
They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences . 
But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become . 
This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy . 
Today's campers want comforts , and they have them . 
And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping . 
It's fun , and it's easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking , and tent keeping , for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families . 
Camp meals are no great problem . 
Neither are beds , thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags . 
Neither are shelters , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper . 
But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs . 
Throughout history , the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad . 
Since the Industrial Revolution , when factories emerged , this classical pattern has been followed . 
Until recently . 
There have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator , willingly or not , and found he didn't like it ; ; 
the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ; ; 
and much more commonly in recent years , the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions . 
There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work , to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss . 
This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology . 
The remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant , at special schools , or in university `` crash '' courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates . 
But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer . 
Some men have no talent for or interest in management ; ; 
forcing them into management can only create trouble . 
The old shop adage still holds : `` A good mechanic is usually a bad boss '' . 
Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success . 
Labor fights to change its collar from blue to white . 
All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures . 
As several recent books have over-emphasized , we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world . 
What can be done for the `` individual contributor '' who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company ? ? 
He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside ; ; 
usually concerned about America's belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles . 
Yet titles are traditionally given only to management men , and income tends to rise with title . 
Even the college professor in America has been affected . 
It is , as one engineer says , `` indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills . 
This difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course . 
This leads one to conclude , as you have , that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people '' . 
Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers . 
So we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the `` dual-road-up '' problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions . 
In the paragraphs that follow , we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page . 
First : what title , what setup ? ? 
Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of General Electric . 
This is not a mutually exclusive plan ; ; 
there is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward . 
Further , the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path . 
It is common to shift back and forth , working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions . 
Actually , there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide `` services '' operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities . 
Also , moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert . 
As examples at GE : Glen B. Warren , formerly manager of the Turbine Division , widely recognized as a turbine designer . 
The late W. R. G. Baker , a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the Electronics Division , and later , by his own choice , an individual consultant . 
Harold E. Strang , expert in switchgear design , for a long period vp & gm of the Measurements & Industrial Products Division , and who currently , approaching retirement , is vice-president and consulting engineer in the Switchgear & Control Division . 
In the GE plan , a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers . 
These positions carry such titles as : 
Consultant , Advanced Development 
Consulting Engineer , 
Consulting Engineer , Heat Transfer 
Consulting Electrical Engineer , 
Senior Electrical Engineer , 
Senior Physicist . 
Westinghouse has a similar system , with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side : consulting engineer or scientist , as the case may be , and advisory engineer or scientist . 
Many companies have systems , particularly in R & D , which work more or less well , depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration , as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations . 
Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is , as one man says it : `` that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach '' . 
Senior staff engineer ? ? 
One company instituted , early in 1959 , a vertical classification system consisting of four levels . 
There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks ; ; 
the top non-supervisory level , senior staff engineer , enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision . 
The second level , senior engineer , rates slightly below first-level supervision . 
The expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level , with very few coming from the first level . 
The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers , but probably not into executive levels . 
In this organization , about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision , engineering or elsewhere . 
This reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military . 
Several other examples : central and satellite 
`` We have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer . 
We have set up a central R & D department , as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants . 
A separate research department is , of course , confined to new or future designs . 
Part of this headquarters staff , however , are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management . 
These headquarters engineers , headed by the vice-president -- Engineering , counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design ; ; 
and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions . 
These men are considered managers of engineers . 
They must learn to wear several hats , so to speak , working with management , sales and engineering problems related to the product . 
`` We do not have people in our organization termed ' consultants ' or ' fellows ' , who are specialists in one particular technical subject . 
I suppose it is because we are just not big enough . 
We have a few ' consultants ' -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems . 
The only ' fellows ' in our company are those who have been honored by ASME , AIEE or AIChE . 
I am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability '' . 
Another structure 
`` We have tried to make both paths attractive , so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either . 
One way to formalize this is in the job structure . 
We have these positions , which compare directly : Af 
`` Above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of Engrg , R & Aj . 
The latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side . 
We have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management , but I believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president '' . 
Top job : research scientist 
`` . 
Approximately four years ago , we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons . 
The highest position is known as a ' research scientist . 
This approach has not been entirely satisfactory . 
The primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves , and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society . 
Scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it . 
We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important ; ; 
and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols , support of the ' dual-ladder ' plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions . 
`` A serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level . 
With no set standards , there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance . 
Promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit . 
If no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level , the result is a department top-heavy with high-level , high-salaried personnel '' . 
Staff engineer dept. manager 
`` We have two approaches for the technical man : the position of staff engineer , which is rated as high in salary as department manager ; ; 
and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible , thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work . 
These are only halfway measures , and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige '' . 
A complete plan 
`` We have made limited application of the ' parallel ladder ' plan . 
The highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is ' research engineer . 
The salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ) . 
We also have an ' engineering section head -- research engineer ' classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer . 
Above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder . 
`` We also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a ' professional ' and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence . 
These include encouragement of , and assistance to , the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers . 
We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity , a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company , and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers . 
Publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies . 
`` A recent , and more pertinent action , has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for Engineering . 
This function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title , member of the technical staff . 
Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management . 
Additional symbols of status are granted , such as reserved parking , distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges , and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit . 
`` We presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center . 
Operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status . 
All scientific staff members will have the title , ' research-staff member . 
The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field . 
Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations , the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member , therefore , are not necessarily evaluated as highly . 
`` These recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence . 
It is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts . 
Fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that , in the business community , prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions '' . 
Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called `` Oakwood Heights '' . 
As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14,000 range . 
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular . 
Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point . 
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State Pipeline Corporation , with principal offices in New York State . 
Its president is Otis M. Waters , partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters , 540-K Chrysler Bldg. , New York City . 
Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter . 
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft Distributors , Inc. , Newburgh , N.Y. . 
The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty . 
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.S. and Canada , even overseas , write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it's feasible and where it is being done . 
Its editors only knew of one example to point to , a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March , 1950 issue . 
This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered . 
Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family . 
Common complaints included `` Mrs. Murphy '' leaving her windows open all the time , a fresh air fan , or the family was visiting `` Aunt Minnie '' with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil . 
As a result of that attitude , others have been discouraged from trying central distribution . 
A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights . 
Called a `` Slo-Flo '' meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles , a key individual being Don Nelson . 
Tri-State has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern , principal heating states . 
There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed by a lawyer . 
The earlier New Haven development was public housing , so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture . 
These have to do with property rights , municipal official attitudes and a host of others . 
In working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project , for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally . 
It is always difficult , or at least time-consuming , to get approval of any kind of line under a public street , as one example . 
To overcome this , the builder lays and completes the street himself , then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines . 
When a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-State . 
For the central storage , Tri-State buys one acre , Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece . 
In other words , the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-State . 
How does Tri-State get its revenue from this plan ? ? 
It leases the whole facility to a large oil company , at least large enough to have a strong credit position . 
This first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years . 
The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes , is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties . 
On this first venture the central storage is 20,000 gallons , in two tanks , or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes . 
The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads , so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies . 
However , that is not all he has to do . 
He must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating . 
In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups . 
Again , the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best . 
For this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor . 
The major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low . 
Initial considerations 
The officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles , as well as personalities that might be affected . 
For example , the officials of Poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem . 
The central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing , with fewer trucks in the residential streets . 
The Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility , subject to their many regulations . 
Several financial institutions , both banks and insurance companies , have been sounded out . 
They like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies . 
The Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation . 
There must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil , an obvious precaution , since the account is permanently wedded , just like with gas or electricity . 
For a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4'' '' X-Tru-Coat , a product of Republic Steel Corp. , and all lines are welded . 
They are laid a minimum of 24'' '' deep and in some areas four feet down , particularly under roads , to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking . 
The meter is mounted high on the basement wall . 
Its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read , even into tenth gallons . 
It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour . 
Ritter , the builder , is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters . 
He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available . 
It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods , and that's an understatement . 
The job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging . 
But in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple . 
Future plans 
What does Tri-State actually want to do , now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the `` patent applied for '' stage ? ? 
It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects , by financing and installing the storage , piping and meters , and leasing these for 15 years , with renewal options , to a strong oil company . 
It may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters , letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities . 
This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers , for the idea has so often been mentioned , somewhat wistfully . 
But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights . 
Only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th ; ; 
others were building . 
The big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves . 
A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches , and the town building inspector was paying a friendly , if curious , visit . 
The oilheating industry is looking up , led by a revival of research and development . 
A primary ingredient in these fields is imagination , and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark . 
Every year about this time National Gargle Your Cooling System week rolls around . 
It pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works . 
Do it this way for the summer gargle : 
First , drain that old coolant down the storm sewer . 
Don't save the anti-freeze , even if it the expensive `` permanent '' type . 
The word means it won't boil away easily , nothing else . 
The rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year , and you don't want to risk the rust that two years' use could mean . 
Pitch it out . 
If a lot of rust shows in the drain , use a good flushing cleaner . 
Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor . 
Of course , you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators . 
Now , check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections , around the freeze-out plugs , gaskets , water pump seals and heater fittings . 
Next , run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens , and then look for leaks again . 
Be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins . 
Use the air hose for this job . 
Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working . 
If you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as `` Dowguard '' be sure to check it . 
Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years . 
Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer . 
Take precautions now , to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer . 
Don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours . 
Spring and summer may be here officially , but those thermos stay in . 
The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle , will greatly increase the fuel consumption , reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators . 
If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck , check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat . 
The thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly , and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant . 
Are you paying too much for your truck insurance ? ? 
There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage , not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut . 
Have a talk with your insurance agent . 
Be careful that you keep adequate coverage , but look for places to save money . 
First go over the type of coverage you now have . 
Look for these features which may mean you can save : 
Duplicate coverage . 
Avoid doubling up on the same item . 
For example , don't pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy . 
Does your policy have a lay-up clause ? ? 
This means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days , insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you . 
This applies to repair work of winter storage . 
The figure five is important in insurance . 
With many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs . 
This means either cars or trucks . 
Discounts run up to 2% of cost . 
Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan . 
For example : If your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250 , a 25% premium saving is often made . 
In the period since the end of World War 2 , -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful , the unusual , and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field . 
The importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry , however , is not in terms of volume alone . 
Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries . 
Many of today's developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays ; ; 
the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers ; ; 
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons , medallions , etc. , owes much to the field , as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics . 
There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below . 
The concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p. 92 ) , as just one example , offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved . 
A volume market 
According to a recent Wall Street Journal survey , plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales . 
Five years ago , they had only 10% of the market , with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing . 
And it's far from the end for plastics . 
Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction . 
Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. . 
Four years ago , the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs ; ; 
today , 85% is in plastics . 
From the volume standpoint , the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive . 
Aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million . 
Currently , there are some 6000 companies in the field , ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal , electrical , and plastic components . 
Why the trend to plastics ? ? 
What accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field ? ? 
Out of many factors which might be cited , five are most important : 1 . 
Plastics combine such properties as built-in color , light weight , optional transparency or translucency , resistance to corrosion , as well as the ease of fabrication . 
2 . 
Plastic signs are economical . 
According to one major producer , materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit . 
Shipping cost is also reduced ; ; 
a 3-by-6-ft. plastic sign weighs about 120 lb. , compared to 275-300 lb. for neon . 
The weight advantage , plus greater durability of the plastic unit , yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping . 
The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed . 
Finally , maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs . 
3 . 
They offer exceptional design freedom , making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer . 
Vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics . 
Pre-decoration , low-cost molds , and the freedom to form large and small , thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry . 
4 . 
Plastic signs work around the clock . 
Internal illumination , protected from the elements , gives them powerful visual appeal at night ; ; 
during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest . 
5 . 
Advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques , ranging from injection molding for intricate , smaller-size , mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs . 
Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding . 
What plastics to use ? ? 
For outdoor signs and displays , acrylic , with its outstanding optical characteristics , weather resistance and formability , strongly dominates the picture . 
At present , both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers , with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total . 
( See panel , p. 166 , for a comparison . 
) 
Of interest is a recent announcement by Du Pont's Polychemicals Dept. of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as Monocite H 100 , which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry . 
Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass , is impervious to all kinds of weather , and will not yellow . 
Its high impact strength , even at low temperatures , resists chipping , cracking , and crazing , according to Du Pont . 
Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs , background panels , and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness , ease of forming , and excellent weathering properties . 
Its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors . 
New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color . 
Thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign . 
( see MPl , Mar. 1961 , p. 98 ) . 
For specialized types of displays , such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product , package , human or animal figures , etc. , reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used . 
A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film , now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ) . 
For outdoor signs and displays , where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor , the choice of plastics is almost unlimited . 
Here may be found regular and impact styrene , cellulose acetate , cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate , acrylic , vinyl , expandable styrene foam , and polyethylene . 
The final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs , method of fabrication , degree of complexity , number of units required , time available for tooling , and projected life expectancy of the unit . 
Often , the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques . 
Trans-illuminated billboards 
One of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard , now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance Neon Sign Co. , Los Angeles , and Industrial Electric Inc. , New Orleans , La. . 
The essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former , constructed of translucent plastic panels , are lighted from within . 
With the source of light behind the copy , there is no loss of lumen output , as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light . 
Also , the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign . 
The copy itself , including any text or illustrations , is reproduced in full color directly on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process . 
The film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign , and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required . 
Spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another ; ; 
new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip . 
Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied . 
Signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities , and others are on the way . 
It is believed that these boards will , within the next few years , replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use . 
Trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions . 
As used by Industrial Electric Inc. , the film panels are printed one at a time , as are 24-sheet posters . 
Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces ; ; 
they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts , or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces . 
In this way , the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media . 
Recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign . 
Comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections , it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit . 
The triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec. of viewing time for each poster subject . 
Sixteen panels , each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft. wide , make up the 25-ft. length of the sign . 
Changeable letters fill many needs 
Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs . 
Signs are meant to convey a message , and in most cases , this requires words and letters . 
Frequently , the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products , price changes , etc. . 
The huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters , in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them . 
Here are some of the newer items currently available : 
Poster Products Inc. , Chicago , Ill. : a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors , onto which are mounted snap-in letters , figures , or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock . 
The background , which is available in various widths and continuous lengths , is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely . 
The Adaptaplex Co. , Beaverton , Ore. : letters molded of butyrate , available in several sizes in either red or black . 
Ideal for merchandising use , they are weather-resistant , and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel . 
For large letters , e.g. thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate , there are other techniques . 
For example , in a typical store installation , fifty 24-in. and six 36-in. red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background . 
The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters . 
Stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains . 
For mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds , very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings , its ends twisted behind the panels . 
Large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations . 
Wagner Sign Service Inc. , Chicago , for example , supplies them in several colors , in heights of 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 17 inches . 
They are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate . 
Also available from this company are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars , extruded of transparent acrylic material , which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material . 
Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft. , the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters . 
Still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products , Azusa , Calif. . 
This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in. ( or smaller ) panels formed of 0.080-in. clear butyrate sheet stock , masked and sprayed on the rear side . 
Finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in. aluminum , which may be mounted to various surfaces . 
The sheets are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co. , Los Angeles , Calif. . 
On large-area units , where additional structural requirements are imposed , one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e.g. right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate . 
Joined side by side , such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft. high and of unlimited width . 
Letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels , painted on the first surface , or handled in other ways . 
New rule no. 2 : : 
Don't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out 
. 
Don't insert your components into fixed openings , they may or may not fit ; ; 
position your components before you close them in . 
For example : 
Don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances . 
It's a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place . 
Set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom . 
Don't try to wrestle a 400-lb. tub Af through a narrow doorway . 
Finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ) . 
Finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in . 
There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished Af closet . 
Don't position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction ; ; 
that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window . 
You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one , two , three order -- first the stud on one side , then the window , then the stud on the other side . 
Install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling . 
Don't close in your house until everything has been carried in . 
Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage . 
That way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof . 
No auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block . 
And trailer makers , those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders , say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out . 
New rule no. 3 : rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you 
. 
This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all , because : 1 . 
It makes it easy to handle much heavier units , so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside . 
2 . 
It makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929 . 
3 . 
It changes the answers to `` Who should do what , and where '' ? ? 
It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication , where almost everything can be made better and cheaper . 
4 . 
It changes the answers on when to do what at the site . 
For example , instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first . 
Instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see p 121 ) . 
5 . 
It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations . 
Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by `` buying direct '' and short-cutting the dealer . 
But now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house , siding along the sides , trusses on the walls , roofing on the roof , etc. . 
Says Clarence Thompson : `` We dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself '' . 
The revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier . 
The revolution is well under way , but much more remains to be done 
. 
Five years ago a House & Home Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily : 
`` Only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads ; ; 
only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads ; ; 
only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads ; ; 
only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads . 
`` So from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing '' . 
`` That House & Home Round Table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling '' , says Clarence Thompson , long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' Research Council . 
`` It made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer , carrier , equipment maker , dealer , and builder , all working together to cut the cost of materials handling . 
Before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem '' . 
Here is where things stand today : 
1 . 
Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new houses are mechanized . 
There are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it . 
2 . 
Practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber , asphalt shingles , glass block , face brick , plaster , lime , hardboard , gypsum wallboard and sheathing , cement , insulation sheathing , floor tile , acoustical tile , plaster base , and asbestos shingles . 
3 . 
Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need . 
For some significant new items see the pictures . 
4 . 
More than 50% of all lumber is unitized ; ; 
an NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling . 
Of these , 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units , because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost . 
Most of the others will swallow their $.50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer . 
`` With a 15,500-lb. fork-lift , dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time '' , says James Wright of Aj . 
5 . 
Lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48'' '' wide by a nominal 30'' '' high ( or six McCracken packets 24'' '' wide by nominal 7'' '' high ) . 
These units make it easy to load as much as 48,000 bd/ft ( say 120,000 lb in a 50' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars . 
6 . 
The railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars . 
First was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 lb ; ; 
later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $.07/cwt on 70,000 lb-plus carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 lb . 
7 . 
More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars , and NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-B floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf . 
For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper . 
This costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf , but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open . 
These carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder 
. 
Says NRLDA's James Wright : `` Since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's other equipment '' . 
The reason : today's components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper . 
So manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier . 
It cuts the lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it , and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading . 
And it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load , can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases , right on the roof or inside the house ) , and never takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it . 
Says Wright : `` Our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years . 
And most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles '' . 
New rule no. 4 : : 
Restudy what your men do , to help them waste less of the time you pay for 
. 
Half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right , so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time , or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection , or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit , or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip . 
Even `` America's most efficient builder '' , Bob Schmitt of Berea , hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works . 
Already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion . 
Builder Eddie Carr of Washington , past president of NAHB , cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the `` SCR masonry process '' worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the Structural Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less . 
A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process , cut them another $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient , easy-to-spot 100-brick packages . 
The SCR process , with its precision corner-posts , its precision guide lines , its working level scaffold , and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set , but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day . 
See page 156 . 
One good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew . 
Reports Jim Lendrum : `` By studying men on the job , we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three . 
We found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don't make two teams ; ; 
they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper team . 
We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job , five men , not four , is the magic number '' . 
No house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled . 
New rule no. 5 : : 
Don't waste any $.10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $.03 a stud 
. 
This is the most penny-wise , pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit . 
Green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster , when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum . 
But now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels , green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford . 
Green studs cost about $.65 ; ; 
dry studs cost less than $.03 more . 
So if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds , the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud . 
There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone . 
Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance . 
If you've travelled in Europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic . 
Following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new . 
However , after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe , you'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places . 
The champagne at Troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'Argent . 
You can relive history and follow , in fancy , the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot . 
And you don't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the Middle Ages . 
Time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea . 
They've been there since the days of the Moors and the Saracens . 
And what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean ? ? 
An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road . 
For those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage . 
Then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car . 
The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one . 
It is that elemental . 
Almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you . 
You can call one of the car rental services directly ( Hertz , Avis , Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental , and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice , and some transportation lines offer this service as well . 
With few exceptions , your car will be waiting for you at dockside , airport , railroad station or hotel when you arrive , oftentimes at no additional cost . 
You can wait , of course , until you arrive in Europe before renting your car . 
The disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or , during the busy tourist season , when cars are in great demand , you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all . 
Since charges are relatively the same , reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it . 
For those who plan to travel to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city , or even another country , when you are ready to return home . 
At some cities , this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge , and , if you are budget-wise , when you are planning your itinerary , you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries . 
International Touring Documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data . 
A valid American driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal , Spain , Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe . 
If you plan to visit any of these countries , you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3.00 . 
Your insurance , too , with most agencies , is provided with the car , covering comprehensive fire , theft , liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries . 
If you would feel happier with full collision insurance , there is a small additional charge , again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance . 
The average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day . 
The charge is variable , however , and goes as low as $.50 a day in Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece . 
Rental fees are variable , too , throughout the countries of Europe . 
There are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available . 
As in the United States , there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven , and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week . 
It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days . 
It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $.80 to $.90 for the equivalent of a United States gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford , Chevrolet or even a Cadillac , which are available in some countries , it is probably wiser to choose the smaller European makes which average thirty , thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon . 
Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group . 
With the exception of the sports cars , even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation . 
There is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries , however , including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that much greater than for the wee sedans . 
The basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car , but some of them offer supplementary advantages . 
There is the free intra-city `` rent it here , leave it there '' service , as an example , the free delivery and collection at the airport , dockside or your hotel , luggage racks , touring documents and information and other similar services . 
A little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits . 
The investigation will be well worth your time . 
All model cars are not available in all countries . 
Quite naturally , there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country . 
If you would like to start your tour in Italy , where the rental fees are actually the lowest in Europe , Fiats in all sizes are available , as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models . 
If you wish to budget closely on transportation , saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries , one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus $.03 a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon , seating six , at just $1.10 a day and $.105 a kilometer . 
If you will be using your car more than fifteen days , which isn't all unlikely , the daily rates drop quite sharply to $.86 a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $.30 a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon . 
With six in the group , the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee . 
In the majority of countries , however , the rates range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger , luxury European models , with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $.03 and going up as high as $.12 . 
The same model car might be available in six or eight countries , yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven . 
The variations are not too great . 
Rates for American cars are somewhat higher , ranging from about $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible , but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models . 
Rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high , actually the highest in Europe , and , surprisingly enough , they are also quite high in Ireland . 
If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a month , it might be wise for you to lease a car . 
The actual over-all cost , for the first month , will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time , but you will receive a new car . 
You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner , which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout Europe . 
Further , there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car , and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip . 
There is a fairly wide selection of models of English , German and French manufacture from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7 , Citroen 2 CV , Volkswagens , Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca Beaulieu . 
Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in Europe , but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory . 
After the first month , rates are considerably less , averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models . 
There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan . 
For one thing , the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road . 
Then , too , European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them . 
Still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of Europe by car . 
The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car . 
It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be . 
Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00 a day , but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800 . 
The big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven , being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed . 
Since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars , it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less , but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this , provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine . 
The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars . 
However , whether you arrange to have a European or American model , if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party , your transportation expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger . 
This will include your helpful , English-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day . 
If you drive greater distances than that , you'll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment , fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands . 
Of course , if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac limousine just for you and your bride , you'll have a memorable tour , but it won't be cheap , and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes . 
The Office of Business Economics ( OBE ) of the U.S. Department of Commerce provides basic measures of the national economy and current analysis of short-run changes in the economic situation and business outlook .

Technical assistance to small business community 
The Small Business Administration ( SBA ) provides guidance and advice on sources of technical information relating to small business management and research and development of products . 
Small business management 
Practical management problems and their suggested solutions are dealt with in a series of SBA publications . 
These publications , written especially for the managers or owners of small businesses , indirectly aid in community development programs . 
They are written by specialists in numerous types of business enterprises , cover a wide range of subjects , and are directed to the needs and interests of the small firm . 
SBA offers Administrative Management Courses , which are designed to improve the management efficiency and `` know-how '' of small business concerns within a community . 
SBA cosponsors these courses with educational institutions and community groups . 
Through the SBA's Management Counseling Program , practical , personalized advice on sound management principles is available upon request to both prospective and established businessmen in a community . 
One-day conferences covering some specific phase of business management , also part of the continuing activities of the Small Business Administration , aid community economic development programs . 
These short , `` streamlined '' meetings usually are sponsored by local banks , Chambers of Commerce , trade associations , or other civic organizations . 
Product research and development 
Production specialists in SBA regional offices are available to help individual small business concerns with technical production problems . 
Guidance and advice are available on new product research and development ; ; 
new product potential ; ; 
processing methods ; ; 
product and market developments ; ; 
new industrial uses for raw , semi-processed and waste , materials ; ; 
and industrial uses for agricultural products . 
SBA serves also as a clearing house for information on products and processes particularly adaptable for exploitation by small firms . 
This may be helpful in improving the competitive position of established firms through diversification and expansion or through more economical utilization of plant capacity . 
Production assistance 
Production specialists are available in SBA regional offices to help individual small business concerns with technical production problems . 
These problems frequently arise where a firm is making items for the Government not directly along the lines of its normal civilian business or where the Government specifications require operations that the firm did not understand when it undertook the contract . 
Production assistance often takes the form of locating tools or materials which are urgently needed . 
Advice is given also on problems of plant location and plant space . 
Property sales assistance 
The property sales assistance program is designed to assist small business concerns that may wish to buy property offered for sale by the Federal Government . 
Under this program , property sales specialists in the Small Business Administration regional offices help small business concerns to locate Federal property for sale and insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for surplus personal and real property and certain natural resources , including timber from the national forests . 
SBA works closely with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those types of property that small business concerns are most likely to be interested in purchasing . 
Proposed property sales of general interest to small business concerns are publicized through SBA regional news releases , and by `` flyers '' directed to the small business concerns . 
Each SBA regional office also maintains a `` want '' list of surplus property , principally machinery and equipment , desired by small business concerns in its area . 
When suitable equipment is located by the SBA representative , the small business concern is contacted and advised on when , where , and how to bid on such property . 
Facilities inventory 
Section 8-b-2 of the Small Business Act , as amended , authorizes the SBA to make a complete inventory of the productive facilities of small business concerns . 
The Administration maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered . 
It is kept in each Regional office for the small firms within the region . 
Purpose of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities in SBA's facilities register so that the small business concerns may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized by the Congress in establishing the Small Business Administration . 
These services include procurement and technical assistance and notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on Government contracts for products and services within the registrants' field of operations . 
SBA can make complete facilities inventories of all small business concerns in labor surplus areas within budgetary and staff limitations .

Loans 
to small business 
SBA makes loans to individual small business firms , providing them with financing when it is not otherwise available through private lending sources on reasonable terms . 
Many such loans have been made to establish small concerns or to aid in their growth , thereby contributing substantially to community development programs . 
Loan policies 
SBA loans , which may be made to small manufacturers , small business pools , wholesalers , retailers , service establishments and other small businesses ( when financing is not otherwise available to them on reasonable terms ) , are to finance business construction , conversion , or expansion ; ; 
the purchase of equipment , facilities , machinery , supplies , or materials ; ; 
or to supply working capital . 
Evidence that other sources of financing are unavailable must be provided . 
Types of loans 
SBA business loans are of two types : `` participation '' and `` direct '' . 
Participation loans are those made jointly by the SBA and banks or other private lending institutions . 
Direct loans are those made by SBA alone . 
To qualify for either type of loan , an applicant must be a small business or approved small business `` pool '' and must meet certain credit requirements . 
A small business is defined as one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field . 
In addition , the SBA uses such criteria as number of employees and dollar volume of the business . 
Credit requirements 
The credit requirements stipulate that the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully and have enough capital in the business so that , with loan assistance from the SBA , it will be able to operate on a sound financial basis . 
A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently secured so as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment . 
The record of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income . 
Loan amount 
The amount which may be borrowed from the SBA depends on how much is required to carry out the intended purpose of the loan . 
The maximum loan which SBA may make to any one borrower is $350,000 . 
Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments -- usually monthly , including interest at the rate of 5-1/2 percent per annum on the unpaid balance -- and have a maximum maturity of 10 years ; ; 
the term of loans for working capital is 6 years .

To cooperatives 
The Farm Credit Administration , an independent agency located within the Department of Agriculture , supervises and coordinates a cooperative credit system for agriculture . 
The system is composed of three credit services , Federal Land Banks and National Farm Loan Associations , Federal Intermediate ( short-term ) Credit Banks , and Banks for Cooperatives . 
This system provides long- and short-term credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing , purchasing , and business service organizations . 
As a source of investment capital , the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages the development of industries in rural areas . 
The credit provdied by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for general agricultural purposes . 
The third credit service , Banks for Cooperatives , exists under authority of the Farm Credit Act of 1933 . 
The Banks for Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent source of credit on a sound basis for farmers' cooperatives . 
Types of loans 
Three distinct classes of loans are made available to farmers' cooperatives by the Banks for Cooperatives : Commodity loans , operating capital loans , and facility loans . 
Eligibility 
To be eligible to borrow from a Bank for Cooperatives , a cooperative must be an association in which farmers act together in processing and marketing farm products , purchasing farm supplies , or furnishing farm business services , and must meet the requirements set forth in the Farm Credit Act of 1933 , as amended . 
Interest rates 
Interest rates are determined by the board of directors of the bank with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration .

Minerals exploration 
To encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals , the Office of Minerals Exploration ( OME ) of the U.S. Department of the Interior offers financial assistance to firms and individuals who desire to explore their properties or claims for 1 or more of the 32 mineral commodities listed in the OME regulations . 
Requirements 
This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds from commercial sources on reasonable terms . 
Each applicant is required to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored . 
The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses . 
The applicant pays the rest of the cost , but his own time spent on the work and charges for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied toward his share of the cost . 
Repayment 
Funds contributed by the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property . 
If nothing is produced , there is no obligation to repay . 
A 5-percent royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract is in effect ; ; 
if the Government certifies that production may be possible from the property , the royalty obligation continues for the 10-year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government's contribution is repaid with interest . 
The royalty applies to both principal and interest , but it never exceeds 5 percent . 
Contact 
Information , application forms , and assistance in filing may be obtained from the Office of Minerals Exploration , U.S. Department of the Interior , Washington 25 , D.C. , or from the appropriate regional office listed below . 
In most of the less developed countries , however , such programing is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent . 
Only a very few of the more advanced ones , such as India and Pakistan , have developed systematic techniques of programing . 
Others have so-called development plans , but some of these are little more than lists of projects collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals without analysis of the actions required to attain them . 
Only rarely is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation . 
We can help in the planning process 
. 
Neither growth nor a development program can be imposed on a country ; ; 
it must express the nation's own will and goal . 
Nevertheless , we can administer an aid program in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing . 
First , we can encourage responsibility by establishing as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the definition of objectives and the assessment of costs . 
Second , we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on the consistency of such projects with the program . 
Third , we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources . 
This includes assistance in -- assembling the basic economic , financial , technological , and educational information on which programing depends ; ; 
surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad sectors of the economy , such as transport , agriculture , communication , industry , and power ; ; 
designing the financial mechanisms of the economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation ; ; 
and administrative practices which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of programs once established . 
We must use common sense in applying conditions 
. 
The application of conditions in the allocation of aid funds cannot , of course , be mechanical . 
It must be recognized that countries at different stages of development have very different capabilities of meeting such conditions . 
To insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage more rapid growth . 
In the more primitive areas , where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited , some activities may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them before a well worked out program is available . 
Thus , we might provide limited assistance in such fields as education , essential transport , communications , and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country programs . 
In such a case , however , we would encourage the recipient country to get on with its programing task , supply it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task , and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress being made . 
At the other end of the spectrum , where the more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program , we should be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support , in cooperation with other developed countries , of the essential foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program . 
D . 
Encouraging self-help 
1 . 
The reasons for stressing self-help 
A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing is one important kind of self-help . 
There are many others . 
It is vitally important that the new U.S. aid program should encourage all of them , since the main thrust for development must come from the less developed countries themselves . 
External aid can only be marginal , although the margin , as in the case of the Marshall plan , can be decisive . 
External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help . 
U.S. aid , therefore , should increasingly be designed to provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves can take . 
Aid advice is not interference 
. 
In establishing conditions of self-help , it is important that we not expect countries to remake themselves in our image . 
Open societies can take many forms , and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals . 
On the other hand , it is no interference with sovereignty to point out defects where they exist , such as that a plan calls for factories without power to run them , or for institutions without trained personnel to staff them . 
Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned with a country's development potential , we can be blunt in suggesting the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur . 
2 . 
The range of self-help 
The major areas of self-help are the following : ( A ) the effective mobilizing of resources . 
This includes not only development programing , but also establishing tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment ; ; 
fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation ; ; 
and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few . 
( B ) the reduction of dependence on external sources . 
This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises , with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports . 
It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate projects after they are completed . 
( C ) tapping the energies of the entire population . 
For both economic and political reasons all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country . 
Otherwise , development will not lead to longrun stability . 
( D ) honesty in government . 
In many societies , what we regard as corruption , favoritism , and personal influence are so accepted as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted but unfriendly . 
Yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources if dishonesty , corruption , and favoritism are widespread . 
Moreover , tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest . 
Some of the most dramatic successes of Communism in winning local support can be traced to the identification -- correct or not -- of Communist regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption . 
A requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run , but it is politically essential in the long run . 
3 . 
U.S. position on self-help 
The United States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with aid on a sustained basis , tailored to priority needs , to those countries making serious efforts in self-help . 
In many instances it can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such efforts . 
There are other countries where , with skillful diplomacy , we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measures to promote growth . 
Governments are rarely monolithic . 
But there will be still other countries where , despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help , we shall deem it wise , for political or military reasons , to give substantial economic assistance . 
Even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to termination . 
E . 
Encouraging a long-term approach 
1 . 
Development requires a long-term approach 
. 
The most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention , our resources , and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less developed countries . 
This is not a short-run goal . 
To have any success in this effort , we must ourselves view it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years , and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same fashion . 
Most of our aid will go to those nearing self-sufficiency 
. 
How long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country . 
In several significant cases , such as India , a decade of concentrated effort can launch these countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance . 
These cases in which light is already visible at the other end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb the bulk of our capital assistance . 
Gradually others will move up to the same level 
. 
The number of countries thus favorably situated is small , but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world . 
Meantime , over the decade of the sixties , we can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth . 
In still others which are barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity , the decade can bring significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded range of developmental activities is possible . 
Aid is a long-term process 
. 
The whole program must be conceived of as an effort , stretching over a considerable number of years , to alter the basic social and economic conditions in the less developed world . 
It must be recognized as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba . 
It is not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted . 
2 . 
The specific reasons for a long-term approach 
( A ) the need to budget a period of years . 
Many of the individual projects for which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy periods . 
Dams , river development schemes , transportation networks , educational systems require years to construct . 
Moreover , on complex projects , design work must be completed and orders for machinery and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence . 
Thus , as a development program is being launched , commitments and obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year . 
The capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs . 
( B ) the need to plan investment programs . 
More importantly , several of the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities involved are all to take place in the proper sequence . 
Without such forward planning , investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities are completed before there is power to operate them or before there is transport to service them ; ; 
or a skilled labor force is trained before there are plants available in which they can be employed . 
( C ) the need to allocate country resources . 
Most important of all , the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary steps to allocate and commit their own resources . 
They must be induced to establish the necessary tax , fiscal , monetary , and regulatory policies . 
They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help measures which are described in the preceding section . 
The taking of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions . 
Moreover , once these steps are taken , they may require years to make themselves felt . 
They must , therefore , be related to long-range development plans . 
3 . 
Providing an incentive 
If the less developed countries are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach , the United States , as the principal supplier of external aid , must be prepared to give long-term commitments . 
In this , as in so many aspects of our development assistance activities , the incentive effects of the posture we take are the most important ones . 
The extent to which we can persuade the less developed countries to appraise their own resources , to set targets toward which they should be working , to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate attention , and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves , all on a realistic long-term basis , will depend importantly on the incentives we place before them . 
If they feel that we are taking a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities , they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required . 
Perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we have responded with long-term commitments . 
You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and the Hitlers and the Mussolinis , the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs , come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation that mankind has ever known . 
Then I have seen the pride of country well in the eyes of these young people . 
So , I say , Mr. Speaker , God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body but for the United States of America and the free world . 
You remember the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago , when someone asked him when he was in Canada , and Dean Rusk was in Europe , and Vice President Johnson was in Asia , `` Who is running the store '' ? ? 
And he said , `` The same fellow who has been running it , Sam Rayburn '' . 
General leave to extend 
Mr. McCormack . 
Mr. Speaker , I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the record ; ; 
and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend their remarks . 
The speaker pro tempore . 
Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts ? ? 
There was no objection . 
Remarks of Hon. Joseph P. Addabbo of New York 
Mr. Addabbo . 
It is notably significant that so many Members from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for our beloved Speaker , the Honorable Sam Rayburn . 
I purposely refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from the State of Texas . 
I did so because I agree with so many here today , that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United States . 
For the dignity , the influence , and the power of the legislative branch of our Government -- it is a privilege for us to do honor to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all the people of our country . 
To honor him is to honor ourselves . 
In this my first year as a Member of this body I have experienced many memorable moments . 
Many of these experiences are so important that they will be cherished forever by me . 
And , like many of you here present , I hold as the highlight of all , the occasion of my first meeting with the honorable Speaker of the House . 
At that time , he afforded me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need , to speak about my background , my hopes , my views on various national and local topics , and any problems that I may have been vexed with at the time . 
He was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me and tremendously wise in his counsel . 
In conclusion , he wished me well -- and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express himself , he asked to be remembered to my wife and children . 
In my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle . 
He is most effective in the ordinary business of the House , and in the legislative accomplishments of this session , he easily rose to great occasion -- even at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle -- and as the Nation witnessed these contests , he rose , even as admitted by those who differed with him , to the proportions of a hero and a noble partisan . 
I am highly privileged today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant . 
He will ever be my example as a true statesman ; ; 
one who is thoroughly human , who affects no dignity , and who is endowed with real ability , genuine worth , and sterling honesty -- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the country he has loved and served so long . 
May the Divine Speaker in Heaven bless this country with Sam Rayburn's continued service here for years to come . 
Remarks of Hon. Wayne L. Hays of Ohio 
Mr. Hays . 
It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues in this paean of praise , respect , and affection for Speaker Sam Rayburn . 
In this hour of crisis , the wisdom , the dedication , the stabilizing force that he represents in current American government is an almost indispensable source of strength . 
He has become in this half century the grand old man of American history . 
It seems to me that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to Providence that Sam Rayburn's vigor and his life remain undiminished through the coming decades . 
Here briefly in this humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country . 
But the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions Sam Rayburn has made as an individual , as a legislator , as a statesman and as a leader and conciliator , to the majestic progress of this Nation . 
It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel deeply about the needs , the aspirations , the interests of my district and my State . 
What Sam Rayburn's life proves to us all is the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests of one's own community , one's own district , one's own State , and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of the problems of this the greatest nation of all time . 
For Sam Rayburn never forgot Bonham , his home community , and he never forgot Texas . 
In the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as legislators to our community , our district , our State . 
And , if we follow the Rayburn pattern , as consciously or by an instinctual political sense I like to think I have followed it , then the very nature of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected in the devotion of our services to our country . 
For what Sam Rayburn's life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your country and neglecting your district . 
There is no such thing as being diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs . 
The two are as one . 
This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes close to being the greatest lesson Sam Rayburn's career , up to this hour , teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political life under our processes of government . 
More than that , Sam Rayburn is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count some of his best friends in the opposition . 
Through the most rancorous battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example of dignity and honesty , forthrightness and nobility . 
Sam Rayburn has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions . 
This means much to the American tradition . 
It is an answer in its way , individual and highly dramatic , to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily vicious in its campaign characteristics . 
And the name Rayburn is one of the most dominant in the history of American politics for the last half century . 
It is , I insist , hard to define the Rayburn contribution to our political civilization because it is so massive and so widespread and so complicated , and because it goes so deep . 
But this we know : Here is a great life that in every area of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities of honor , decency , and self-respect . 
I pray to God that he may be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United States and the whole world can ill afford to lose . 
Remarks of Hon. Melvin Price of Illinois 
Mr. Price . 
All but two of my nine terms in the House of Representatives has been served under the Speakership of Sam Rayburn . 
Of this I am proud . 
I have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carries his greatness . 
And Sam Rayburn is a great man -- one who will go down in American history as a truly great leader of the Nation . 
He will be considered not only great among his contemporaries , but as great among all the Americans who have played a part in the country's history since the beginning . 
I pay my personal tribute to Sam Rayburn , stalwart Texan and great American , not only because today he establishes a record of having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than twice as long as Henry Clay , but because of the contributions he has made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half century of service as a Member of Congress . 
Speaker Rayburn has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction of the House in the Speaker's chair . 
He had an outstanding record as a legislator since the start of his career in the House in 1913 , the 63d Congress . 
No one has sponsored more progressive and important legislation than has Sam Rayburn . 
He is the recognized `` father '' of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security and Exchange Commission . 
But to run the gauntlet of the programs Sam Rayburn brought into being through his legislative efforts would fill the pages of today's Record . 
No greater pleasure has come to me in my own service in this House than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker , this great legislator , this great Texan , this great American . 
My sincere wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today . 
Remarks of Hon. John S. Monagan of Connecticut 
Mr. Monagan . 
Sam Rayburn is one of the greatest American public figures in the history of our country and I consider that I have been singly honored in the privilege of knowing Sam Rayburn and sharing with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House of Representatives in the Congress of the United States . 
Others may speak of Speaker Rayburn's uniquely long and devoted service ; ; 
of his championship of many of the progressive social measures which adorn our statute books today , and of his cooperation in times of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today's stormy international seas . 
I prefer to speak , however , of Sam Rayburn , the person , rather than Sam Rayburn , the American institution . 
Although Sam Rayburn affects a gruff exterior in many instances , nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition . 
No one could be more devoted than he to the American Congress as an institution and more aware of its historical significance in the political history of the world , and I shall never forget his moving talks , delivered in simple yet eloquent words , upon the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative government and their importance in the context of today's assault upon popular government . 
Above all , he is a person to whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman . 
In this role of father confessor , he has always been most characteristic and most helpful . 
On September 16 , Sam Rayburn will have served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud to join with others in marking this date , and in expressing my esteem for that notable American , Sam Rayburn . 
Origin of state automobile practices . 
The practice of state-owned vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years . 
At least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917 . 
The state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940 . 
The automobile maintenance unit , or motor pool , came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time . 
The motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive management including establishment of cost billing systems , records keeping , analyses of vehicle use , and effecting economies in vehicle operation . 
Cars were operated in 1959 for an average $.027 per mile . 
Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state purchases . 
Unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state sales or federal excise taxes . 
Vehicle purchase , assignment and use policies . 
The legislature's role in policy determination concerning state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to appropriating funds for vehicles . 
The meaningful policies governing the purchase , assignment , use and management of state vehicles have been shaped by the state's administrative officers . 
Meaningful policies include : ( A ) kinds of cars the state should own , ( B ) when cars should be traded , ( C ) the need and assignment of vehicles , ( D ) use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances , ( E ) employees taking cars home , and ( F ) need for liability insurance on state automobiles . 
A review of these policies indicates : ( 1 ) 
The state purchases and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle . 
( 2 ) 
The purchase of compact ( economy ) cars is being made currently on a test basis . 
( 3 ) 
Cars are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy . 
( 4 ) 
The factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible according to circumstances . 
( 5 ) 
Unsuccessful efforts have been made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles . 
( 6 ) 
It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage state cars at their homes . 
( 7 ) 
The state has recently undertaken liability insurance for drivers of state cars . 
Automobile practices in other states . 
A survey of practices and/or policies in other states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals several points for comparison with Rhode Island's practices . 
Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state business . 
Two other states provide vehicles , but only with legislative approval . 
States which provide automobiles for employees assign them variously to the agency , the individual , or to a central pool . 
Twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition , allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned vehicles . 
Nineteen states report laws , policies or regulations for assigning state vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances . 
Of these states the average `` change-over '' point ( at which a car is substituted for allowances ) is 13,200 miles per year . 
Mileage allowances . 
Mileage allowances for state employees are of two types : ( A ) actual mileage and ( B ) fixed monthly allowances . 
Actual mileage allowances are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned vehicles on state business at the rate of $.07 per mile . 
Fixed monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis . 
Both allowances are governed by conditions and restrictions set forth in detail in the state's Travel Regulations . 
Rhode Island's reimburseable rate of $.07 per mile for use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states' rates . 
The average of states' rates is $.076 per mile . 
Rhode Island's rate of $.07 per mile is considerably lower than reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a $.09 per mile average . 
Actual mileage allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state . 
The travel regulations , requirements and procedures governing reimbursement are controlled properly and not overly restrictive . 
Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject . 
They have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment . 
However , they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measures . 
Flat payments over $50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicles . 
Travel allowances . 
Travel allowances , including subsistence , have been revised by administrative officials recently and compare favorably with other states' allowances . 
With few exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses and $15 per day subsistence . 
Travel allowances are well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control . 
Origin of state automobile practices 
general background . 
It is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles for use of employees in Rhode Island . 
Few records are available concerning the subject prior to 1940 . 
Those that are available shed little light . 
The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917 . 
It should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old . 
The best reason that can be advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded highway construction during the 1920s and '30s . 
At that time highway engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties . 
Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees , and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly justifiable . 
Once the principle was established , the increase in state-owned vehicles came rapidly . 
And reasons other than employee need contributed to the growth . 
Table 1 immediately below shows the rate of growth of vehicles and employees . 
This rate of increase does not signify anything in itself . 
It does not indicate loose management , ineffective controls or poor policy . 
But it does show that automobiles have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employees . 
In the past twenty years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now . 
Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical . 
The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them . 
History and operation of the motor pool . 
While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured , subsequent developments concerning the assignment , use , and management of state automobiles can be related more clearly . 
Prior to 1942 , automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which assigned . 
This responsibility included all phases of management . 
It embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles , who was to drive , when and where repairs were to be made , where gasoline and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters . 
In 1942 , however , the nation was at war . 
Gasoline and automobile tires were rationed commodities . 
The state was confronted with transportation problems similar to those of the individual . 
It met these problems by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit ( more popularly called the motor pool ) , a centralized operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation . 
The motor pool then , as now , had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located throughout the state . 
It was organizationally the responsibility of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation . 
In 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created Department of Administration , an agency established as the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government . 
The management of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in a recent report in the following manner : `` 
Under this new management considerable progress appears to have been made . 
The agencies of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all cars . 
Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained losses considerably beyond expectations , the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping the fund on a proper working basis . 
One indication of the merits of the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 , while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35% , the total maintenance cost increased only 11% . 
`` 
In order to further refine the management of passenger vehicles , on July 1 , 1958 , the actual title to every vehicle was transferred , by Executive Order , to the Division of Methods , Research and Office Services . 
The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility for the management , assignment , and replacement of all vehicles . 
( Note : So far as State Police cars are concerned , only their replacement is under this division ) . 
This tied in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs ( in light of depreciation ) become excessive . 
Moreover , it allows the present management to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly distributed throughout the fleet ; ; 
for example , if one driver puts on 22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year , their cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two years , rather than 44,000 miles ( and related higher maintenance costs ) and 16,000 miles respectively '' . 
The motor pool is a completely centralized and mechanized operation . 
It handles all types of vehicle maintenance , but concentrates more on `` service station activities '' than on extensive vehicle repairs . 
It contracts with outside repair garages for much of the latter work . 
Where the pool excels is in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses . 
Pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon of each vehicle , the miles traveled in one year or three years , the periods when vehicle costs become excessive , and when cars should be traded for sound economies . 
From this , motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and related data . 
In 1959-60 , vehicles averaged an operating cost of $.027 per mile . 
Based on this figure and considering depreciation costs of vehicles , pool personnel have determined that travel in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles . 
They estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact cars is compiled , the break-even point may be reduced to 7,500 miles of travel per year . 
Table 2 shows operating cost data of state vehicles selected at random . 
One matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate central garage facilities . 
Present pool quarters at two locations in Providence are crowded , antiquated and , in general , make for inefficient operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational needs as stock and repair equipment . 
Good facilities would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle costs even more . 
Purchasing practices . 
The purchase of state-owned vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases of the state . 
Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will be made . 
Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the assistance of pool staff , and awards for the purchase of the automobiles are made to the lowest responsible bidders . 
Unit prices for state vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public . 
The reasons are obvious : ( 1 ) the state is buying in quantity , and ( 2 ) it has no federal excise or state sales tax to pay . 
Until 1958 the state was also entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the dealers . 
In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state motor pool , cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier . 
This is a normal governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting principles . 
The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is another matter to be covered in detail later . 
Vehicle purchase , assignment , and use policies 
Probably the most important of all matters for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase , assignment , use , and management of state vehicles . 
The legislature's role in policy determination in this area for years has been confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually for the purchase and operation of vehicles . 
The more meaningful policies have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state -- the Director of Administration . 
The Rhode Island property tax 
There was a time some years ago when local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as well . 
For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property tax . 
This tax was discontinued in 1936 . 
Since that time the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in earlier years . 
At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion of municipal services as well . 
Thus , there has come into being a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and , in addition , must give assistance to its local governments . 
This financial assistance from the state has become necessary because the local governments themselves found the property tax , or at least at the rates then existing , insufficient for their requirements . 
Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and shared taxes , as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a sales tax at the state level . 
Notwithstanding state aid , the local governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own by strengthening the property tax . 
This is being done both by the revaluation of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property hitherto neglected or ignored . 
Taxation of tangible movable property in Rhode Island has been generally of a `` hands off '' nature due possibly to several reasons : ( 1 ) local assessors , in the main , are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs , ( 2 ) the numerous categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely difficult , and ( 3 ) the inexperience of the majority of assessors in evaluating this type of property . 
Problems of taxing personal property . 
Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property , and of movable tangible property in particular , two are significant : ( 1 ) situs , ( 2 ) fair and equitable assessment of value . 
These problems are not local to Rhode Island , but are recognized as common to all states . 
Situs of property . 
Although the laws of the various states , in general , specify the situs of property , i.e. , residence or domicile of the owner , or location of the property , the exceptions regarding boats , airplanes , mobile homes , etc. , seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment . 
Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the town in which it is situated . 
It also provides for the taxation of all personal property , belonging to inhabitants of the state , both tangible and intangible , and the tangible personal property of non-residents in this state . 
In defining personal property , it specifically mentions `` all ships or vessels , at home or abroad '' . 
Intangible property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater portion of the year . 
Although a similar situs for tangible property is mentioned in the statute , this is cancelled out by the provision that definite kinds of property `` and all other tangible property '' situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated . 
This would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at its location on December 31 . 
Both boats and aircraft would fall within this category , as well as motor vehicles . 
The location of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration , and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle as being situated where it is garaged . 
Obviously , it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December . 
In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles for tax purposes , in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or aircraft . 
A recent example of this problem is the flying of six airplanes , on December 31 , 1960 , from the Newport Airpark in Middletown , to the North Central Airport in Smithfield . 
This situation resulted in both towns claiming the tax , and probably justifiably . 
Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that `` all rateable property , both tangible and intangible , shall be taxed to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve ( 12 ) months next preceding the first day of April in each year '' . 
The Smithfield tax assessor , in turn , claims the tax under the provision of law `` and all other tangible personal property situated or being in any town , in or upon any place of storage shall be taxed to such person in the town where said property is situated '' . 
Assessment of value . 
This problem of fair and equitable assessment of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation is dependent on local assessors , who in general are non-professional and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach to the problem . 
This accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in Rhode Island . 
This condition will undoubtedly continue until such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established , or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopted . 
The Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented : `` 
The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing all taxable property . 
An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout the State . 
A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assessing units '' . 
The Institute of Public Administration , in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission in 1959 , recommended `` consolidating and centralizing all aspects of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organized and equipped for the job '' . 
The resulting setup , it was declared , `` would be similar to that which is in successful operation in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode Island '' . 
Practices in Rhode Island . 
To determine the practice and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property , a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or boards of assessors in Rhode Island . 
The replies from each individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the established policy of the town in each case . 
There are legitimate reasons for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among the public officials in each town . 
These opinions of the assessors are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at the present time . 
In reply to a question of whether they now tax boats , airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles , nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not . 
The wording of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different interpretations . 
One assessor checked boats only , another trailers and tractors , one mentioned house trailers , and two others referred to trailers without specifying the type . 
In two cases , airplanes only were indicated . 
It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was meant in each individual situation , but the conclusion may be drawn that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property , and of the remainder only certain types are valued for tax purposes . 
Boats were indicated specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats . 
It would seem , then , that movable property and equipment is not taxed as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property . 
So few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess movable property that the results are inconclusive . 
Only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind . 
Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership . 
Fifteen stated that it was according to location , four by residence of the owner , and nineteen did not answer . 
Twenty-seven assessors stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable personal property , and only five were opposed . 
Seven others expressed no opinion . 
On this point there was fairly general agreement that assessors would like to do more than they are doing now . 
It is not clear , however , whether they are thinking of all movable property or only of boats , trailers , aircraft or certain other types of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns . 
Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or at the residence of the owner . 
Eighteen voted for assessment by the town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town in which the owner resides . 
Ten others made no reply . 
Of those who have an opinion , it seems that assessment by location is preferred . 
There was one vote for location being the place where the property is situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment date . 
To summarize , it may be said that there is no one prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation of movable property , that assessors would like to see an improvement , and of those who have an opinion , that assessment by the town of location is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge . 
The need for greater knowledge is evident from their replies . 
Boats as personal property 
taxing of boats . 
Interest has been shown for a number of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats . 
Assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation upon real and personal property , but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax `` a sum not less than nor more than '' a specified amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting . 
It has been obvious to the assessors , particularly those in shore communities , that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal property which they have been unable to reach . 
Through their professional organization , the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed . 
No satisfactory solution has been found , but this is due more to the difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessors . 
It has been estimated that the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess of fifty million dollars , excluding commercial boats . 
It is obvious that this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation . 
It is known that at least five towns ( Barrington , Bristol , Narragansett , Newport and Westerly ) place some value on some boats for tax purposes . 
However , few are taxed , and the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on the date of assessment of town valuations . 
No one really knows how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may be . 
Slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard prior to the recent passage of the state boating law . 
Only a few more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season , but many had been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought the season to an early close . 
The assessors' association , meeting at Narragansett in September 1960 , devoted its session to a discussion of the boat problem . 
Local industry's investment in Rhode Island was the big story in 1960's industrial development effort . 
Fifty-two companies started or committed themselves to new plant construction , totaling 1,418,000 square feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000 ; ; 
a new post-World War 2 , record . 
With minor exceptions , this expansion was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state manufacturers already operating here . 
What made these new location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation , Rhode Island scored marked progress in new industry , new plants , and new jobs . 
Of the major expansions in 1960 , three were financed under the R. I. Industrial Building Authority's 100% guaranteed mortgage plan : Collyer Wire , Leesona Corporation , and American Tube & Controls . 
Leading firms that arranged their own financing included Speidel Corporation , Cornell-Dubilier , Photek , Inc. Division of Textron , Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry , W. R. Cobb Company , and Mays Manufacturing Company . 
Expansion and relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility of the Development Council's Industrial Division , and the figures quoted above indicate a successful year's operation . 
Industrial Division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode Island concerns during 1960 , many of whom are still interested in a Rhode Island location . 
They are conscious of this state's new feeling of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island . 
Aids to small business 
Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by major industries , small business is also afforded considerable attention . 
Our Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries on a vigorous program , directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of manufacturers in the lower employment categories . 
A primary function is the operation of a Government Bid Center , which receives bids daily from the Federal Government's principal purchasing agencies . 
Assistance is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen concerning interpretation of bid invitations , where to obtain specifications , and follow-ups concerning qualification . 
During the past year , 10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers . 
In addition , the Office's domestic trade program provided consultant services to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses ; ; 
how and where to apply for financial assistance ; ; 
details on marketing ; ; 
information concerning patents , copyrights and trade marks , availability of technical reports , and other subjects of interest to small business . 
The Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is also active in the field of international trade , assisting Rhode Island firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad . 
This office cooperates with the U. S. Department of Commerce in giving statewide coverage to services which include : statistics on markets abroad ; ; 
locating foreign agents , buyers , distributors , etc. ; ; 
information on foreign and domestic import duties and regulations , licensing , investments , and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad , and documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements for payment . 
During the year 1960 , this office supplied 954 visitors with information related to foreign and domestic commerce , and made 73 field visits . 
Advertising program 
Our media advertising continued , during 1960 , its previous effective program that stressed such specifics as 100% financing , plant availabilities , and location advantages . 
We also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established new plants here . 
To reach a still greater audience of location-minded manufacturers , our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000 , and the Industrial Building Authority's financial participation was upped from $17,000 to $20,000 . 
Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal ( Eastern and Midwestern editions ) which averaged two prominent ads per month , and to a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and , for the west coast , the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal ( Pacific Coast edition ) . 
In addition to the regular schedule , advertisements were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times , Boston Herald , American Banker , Electronic News and , for local promotion , the Providence Sunday Journal . 
Magazine advertising included Management Methods , The New Englander , U. S. Investor , and Plant Location . 
The direct mail campaign consisted of 3 intra-state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed to electronics , plastics , pharmaceutical , and business machine manufacturers , and to publishers . 
These totaled 6,768 pieces of correspondence . 
The 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of 239 inquiries ; ; 
164 from media and 75 from direct mail . 
Two hundred and nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from foreign countries . 
New York led in the number of inquiries , followed by California , New Jersey , Massachusetts , and Pennsylvania . 
Among foreign countries responding were Germany , Canada , Brazil and India . 
Industrial promotion 
An important operation in soliciting industrial locations involves what we term `` Missionary calls '' by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists . 
These consist of visits , without previous announcement , on top officials of manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas . 
More than 25 carefully selected cities were visited , including New York , Brooklyn , Long Island City , Newark , Elizabeth , Stamford , Waterbury , New Haven , Bridgeport , Boston , Cambridge , Worcester , and Waltham . 
Out of a total of 603 calls , 452 contacts were established with top executive personnel . 
We received 76 out-of-state visitors interested in investigating Rhode Island's industrial advantages , and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up visits . 
Industrial conferences 
During 1960 , two important conferences were organized by the Development Council's Industrial Division . 
In June , the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce -- in conjunction with local trade associations , chambers of commerce , and bank officials -- sponsored a World Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel . 
Its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the United States' declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959 . 
Approximately 100 representatives of business attended this conclave and the R. I. Export Conference Committee later voted to continue the activity as an annual event . 
On October 8th of last year , the Industrial Division sponsored the Governor's Conference on Industrial Development at the former Henry Barnard School . 
A comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development effort attracted 143 interested individuals . 
Morning sessions included addresses by Ward Miller , Jr. of the U. S. Dept. of Commerce . 
Richard Preston , executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission , and Edwin C. Kepler of General Electric Company . 
Workshop sessions in the afternoon featured development executives from Pennsylvania , Connecticut and Maine , and rounded out a rewarding program . 
In connection with this conference , a 64-page supplement was published in the October 2nd edition of The Providence Sunday Journal . 
Devoted to the improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction in Rhode Island , it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this Division . 
More than 2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients . 
Mailings and publications 
Other special mailings by the Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's Conference , letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society of Industrial Realtors . 
1184 copies of the R. I. Directory Of Manufacturers were distributed : 643 in-state and 541 out-of-state . 
The Industrial Division published , in 1960 , a new , attractive industrial brochure , `` Rhode Island -- Right For Industry '' , and prepared copy for a new edition of the Directory Of Manufacturers ( to be printed shortly ) , and for a new space catalogue . 
Additional promotional activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation Turnkey , the new automated post office , and a conference with representatives of Brown University , Providence College , and University of Rhode Island , and eight electronics concerns regarding the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel . 
Planning division 
Stated in its simplest terms , the main job of the Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode Island . 
The activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable detail in the enabling act of the Development Council , which assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties in the field of planning . 
Two years ago , the Institute of Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled `` State-Local Relations In Metropolitan Rhode Island . 
As the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in this report , plus an analysis of our own enabling act , the Planning Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused a reorientation of its work program . 
These objectives are stated here because of their importance in understanding the current activities of the Planning Division . 
( 1 ) 
First priority will be given to the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background for all other planning activities in the state . 
( 2 ) 
Recognizing the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration that `` Metropolian Planning ( in Rhode Island ) means , or should mean , state planning '' , the state guide plan will take into account the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island's problems . 
( 3 ) 
It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility of local government . 
To this end , the community assistance program of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function to make available , on a shared cost basis , technical planning assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their own planning staff . 
( 4 ) 
The planning division will take the initiative in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government ; ; 
among the operating departments of the state ; ; 
between the cities and towns of the state ; ; 
and on a regional basis between the six New England states . 
( 5 ) 
On the basis that all citizens of the state are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources , plans for the provision of essential services ( such as water ) will be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries , within the framework of the state plan . 
( 6 ) 
The state development budget will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan . 
( 7 ) 
In preparing the state guide plan , particular attention will be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the development of industry and recreation . 
Functionally the planning division carries out four activities : long-range state planning , current state planning , local planning assistance ; ; 
and the preparation of the state development budget . 
Long-range state planning 
The planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive state planning program in the nation . 
The long-range aspects of this program are divided into four distinct phases : basic mapping , inventory , analysis and plan and policy formation . 
The work program , as it was originally proposed , was to take five years to complete . 
Recent events -- particularly the necessity of providing planning information for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department of Public Works -- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated . 
The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 . 
Basic mapping 
Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning program , the first step taken by the planning division to implement the long-range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps -- one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile , and the second a series of 26 sheets at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet , covering the entire state . 
With these maps completed , the inventory phase of the plan has been started . 
Inventory 
With the aid of matching federal funds available under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended , the planning division began a one year program July 1 , 1960 to complete the inventory phase of the state planning program . 
This phase consists of four items : urban land use , rural land use , physical features and public utility service areas . 
Since the validity of all subsequent planning depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information , great care is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible . 
The urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are of significance to statewide planning . 
The rural land use study is being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use . 
The mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and , like the other two inventory projects , are scheduled for completion July 1 , 1961 . 
Analysis 
The collection of information is meaningless unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose . 
Special districts in Rhode island . 
It is not within the scope of this report to elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in Rhode Island . 
However , a word should be mentioned in regard to them as independent units of government . 
There are forty-seven special district governments in Rhode Island ( excluding two regional school districts , four housing authorities , and the Kent County Water Authority ) . 
These forty-seven special purpose governments have the authority to levy taxes , to borrow money , own property , sue and be sued , and in general to exercise normal corporate powers . 
Unlike cities and towns , however , they do not have to submit any financial statements to the state Bureau of Audits . 
It is not an exaggeration to say that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units of government . 
In addition to the collection of service charges , the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000 . 
Fiscal years in other states 
comparative data . 
A review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent to this report . 
Included in the findings are : 1 . 
Forty-six states , including Rhode Island , end their fiscal year on June 30 . 
The other four states end on varying dates : Alabama ( Sept. 30 ) , New York ( March 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( May 31 ) , and Texas ( August 31 ) . 
2 . 
In sixteen states , the fiscal year ending of the cities ( June 30 ) is the same as that of the state : Alaska , Arizona , California , Delaware , Massachusetts , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , Vermont , West Virginia , Wyoming , and Hawaii ) . 
3 . 
In eleven states , the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31 , while the state fiscal year ends on June 30 ( Arkansas , Colorado , Indiana , Kansas , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Ohio , South Dakota , Utah , Washington , and Wisconsin ) . 
4 . 
In eight states whose fiscal years close on June 30 , a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 31 : : 
( Georgia , Iowa , Kentucky , Maine , Maryland , Minnesota , Virginia , and South Carolina ) . 
5 . 
One state , Alabama , closes its fiscal year on September 30 , and all cities in the state , with one exception , also close fiscal years on September 30 . 
6 . 
Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30 , while all of its cities close their fiscal years on September 30 . 
7 . 
Pennsylvania closes its fiscal year on May 31 . 
All of its cities close their fiscal years on December 31 . 
The remaining twelve states have varying fiscal years for the state , city and local governments . 
However , only Illinois , Oregon , Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity . 
Fiscal uniformity : advantages and disadvantages 
advantages . 
An excellent summary of advantages concerning the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently . 
He listed among the values of fiscal uniformity : 1 . 
The uniform fiscal year requires compliance with common sense administration of local finances : adoption of the budget , or financial plan , in advance of spending . 
2 . 
The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another common sense rule , that of having cash in the bank before checks are drawn . 
It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to take advantage of cash discounts . 
3 . 
The uniform fiscal year promotes more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures . 
By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending , upper limits are set on expenditures . 
4 . 
The uniform fiscal year brings the town's fiscal year into line with that of the schools , which expend the largest share of local disbursements . 
This greatly simplifies the town's bookkeeping and financial reporting . 
5 . 
The uniform fiscal year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax anticipation notes . 
Furthermore , tax collections not immediately needed for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes , augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax levy . 
6 . 
The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison of revenues and expenditures . 
When towns have the same fiscal year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons ; ; 
and as the cost of local government increases , the demand for such comparison also increases . 
Towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare . 
Of all advantages , probably none is more important than the elimination of tax anticipation notes . 
Borrowing in anticipation of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority of municipalities at all times . 
It may be by bank loans , sale of notes or warrants , or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrants . 
In any event it is a form of borrowing which could be and should be rendered unnecessary . 
Its elimination would result in the saving of interest costs , heavy when short-term money rates are high , and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always available when needed most . 
This type of borrowing can be reduced to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year . 
Any approach toward such a system looks toward saving and security . 
It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform fiscal year . 
Both the federal and state governments commence their fiscal years on July 1 . 
Both units of government contribute increasingly large sums of money to the several local governments in this state as indicated below : 
It has been said that when local government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property tax , the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap ; ; 
but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid , the emphasis on equalization , and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important functions , this is no longer true . 
The haphazard fiscal year calendar is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationships . 
Disadvantages . 
Although there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal years in Rhode Island , there are also certain difficulties encountered . 
These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantages to the principle . 
One problem is a matter of shifting dates ; ; 
the other , is how to finance the transition . 
Little can be done about the changing of dates . 
This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars . 
It usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time . 
But cooperation and understanding between local officials and the citizenry help lessen this problem . 
The other problem is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities and towns . 
This will be covered more fully later . 
It should be kept in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city . 
Fortunately , there are no cities or towns in the state , with one or two possible exceptions that are in too difficult a position to finance the proposed change . 
Sacrifice will have to be made in some cases , but it is to the municipality's advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely . 
Adjusting the fiscal calendars 
The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them . 
The type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent of the adjustments needed . 
Two features are immediately evident . 
First , the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single formula . 
Second , the shift to a uniform July 1 to June 30 fiscal year will , of itself , improve the tax collection calendars of the great majority of cities and towns . 
There are at least two problems to consider : one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar ; ; 
the other is how to finance the adjustments when necessary . 
The latter matter is considered in detail in a later section . 
Twelve cities and towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a uniform and/or coordinated fiscal tax year calendar . 
Plans vary from the `` talking stage '' to establishing special committees to accomplish this end . 
What is important here is that many of the cities and towns recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the initiative to obtain them . 
An analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition may not be as painful as is commonly thought . 
However , it must be stressed that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual cities and towns involved . 
The adjustments needed to establish a uniform and coordinated fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout Rhode Island , based on a July 1 to June 30 year , are shown below . 
No adjustment needed . 
Six cities and towns are presently on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection year with it . 
No change is required for these towns . 
These municipalities include : Barrington , Lincoln , Middletown , Newport , North Kingstown , and South Kingstown . 
Adjustment of fiscal year . 
One town and one city , Coventry and East Providence , require an adjustment of their fiscal year only . 
This change will automatically adjust their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year . 
Adjustment of tax collection year . 
Six cities and towns are now on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity . 
These cities and towns include Bristol , Glocester , Pawtucket , Cumberland , Central Falls , and Woonsocket . 
Simultaneous adjustments . 
Two cities to be considered , Providence and Cranston , are an enigma . 
Both have excellent integration of their fiscal tax collection year calendars . 
However , neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1 to June 30 fiscal year . 
The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal period could be accomplished relatively easily for them . 
In that both cities end their fiscal years on September 30 , they could levy taxes for an interim period of nine months , commencing with September 30 and ending with June 30 . 
These three installment dates would be : October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 ( Providence ) and November 15 , February 16 and May 15 ( Cranston ) . 
Both would start their new fiscal year on July 1 . 
Their tax collection calendar could then be : July 25 , October 26 , January 26 , and April 25 , ( Providence ) ; ; 
and August 15 , November 15 , February 17 , and May 15 , ( Cranston ) . 
Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods . 
Varying adjustments . 
The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal years which end prior to June 30 . 
All of these towns will require adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years . 
Assuming an adjustment to the July 1 to June 30 fiscal year , the required adjustment of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 3 . 
Methods of financing adjustments 
Aside from the matter of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars , there is the problem of financing the adjustment when this is necessary . 
It should be emphasized strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets do not necessarily mean financing over and above normal governmental requirements . 
In many communities there is simply no financial problem ; ; 
it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods , careful fiscal planning and management , or some like combination of techniques . 
In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of fiscal year changes . 
Fortunately , such cases in Rhode Island are more the exception than the rule . 
As shown earlier in Table 1 , the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection calendars . 
In addition , no two Rhode Island communities are identical in relation to their over-all financial condition . 
These factors practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible ; ; 
each situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective tax calendars , the financial condition of the treasuries , and the length of the transition interval . 
Suitable plans range from those that are very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds . 
The financial problem , where it exists , usually stems from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period . 
For those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments , there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone , or in combination with others , would minimize if not even eliminate the problem . 
Rhode Island Heritage Week proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , governor 
The theme of Rhode Island Heritage Week for 1961 will be `` Independence and Union '' . 
It commemorates the 185th anniversary of Rhode Island's Independence when , upon May 4 , 1776 , the General Assembly , by its action , established the first free republic in the New World . 
As this year marks the centennial of the beginning of the Civil War , this fact is being commemorated with several exhibits throughout the State , but most of all paying tribute to the first Rhode Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the City of Washington , putting at the disposal of President Lincoln the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time . 
On April 30 , ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers will take place at 1:00 P.M. at the Dexter Training Grounds in Providence . 
The Independence Day celebration will be properly observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick to the Greene Homestead in Anthony ; ; 
and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of april 29th to may 7th , 1961 , as Rhode Island Heritage Week , advising our citizens that throughout this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open to visitors as well as industrial plants , craft shops , museums and libraries and I earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding week . 
In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21st day of April , in the year of Our Lord , one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and on Independence , the one hundred and eighty-fifth .

National defense , like the continuing search for peace with freedom and justice for all , is `` everybody's business '' . 
Our investment in this effort , the greatest in our Nation's history , reflects our determination to ensure the peace and the future of freedom . 
It is a sound investment . 
As the President has said , `` only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never be employed '' . 
Armed Forces Day is the annual report on this investment , a public presentation designed to give our own people , and the people of other lands who stand with us for peace with freedom and justice , the best possible opportunity to see and understand what we have and why we have it . 
It is the purpose of Armed Forces Day to give Americans an opportunity to honor men of the Armed Forces , those who have made the supreme sacrifice , those who remain to preserve our security . 
Freedom depends upon them ; ; 
now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Saturday , May 20th , 1961 , as Armed Forces Day , reminding our citizens that we should rededicate ourselves to our Nation , respecting the uniforms as the guardians of our precious liberty .

National Maritime Day proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor 
The President of the United States , pursuant to a Joint Resolution of Congress , has issued a proclamation each year since 1933 declaring May 22nd to be National Maritime Day . 
This date in 1819 marked the sailing of the S. S. `` Savannah '' from Savannah , Georgia , for Liverpool . 
This voyage was the first successful crossing of the Atlantic under steam propulsion . 
The day is now appropriately set aside to honor the American men and women who have contributed to the success of our merchant marine fleet in peace and war . 
The Merchant Marine is the `` Fourth Arm of Defense '' , for a strong and effective American Merchant Marine is essential to the economy and security of our Nation . 
Through trade and travel across the seas the American Merchant Marine is carrying out its historic mission of linking the United States of America with friendly nations across the seas ; ; 
and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Monday , May 22nd , 1961 , as National Maritime Day , reminding our citizens that American Merchant ships and American seamen are ready at all times to serve our Nation in the cause of freedom and justice .

Miss Rhode Island Pageant Week proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor 
The Miss Rhode Island Pageant is sponsored by the Rhode Island Junior Chamber of Commerce as a part of the nation-wide search for the typical American girl -- a Miss America from Rhode Island . 
This is an official preliminary contest of the Miss America Pageant held each September in Atlantic City . 
The ideal girl -- possessed of talent , poise , intelligence , personality and beauty of face and figure -- is chosen each year to represent Rhode Island . 
Many hours are given free by the Jaycees to make this and all local pageants outstanding events . 
Proceeds realized from these pageants are used by the Jaycees to help support their various youth , health , welfare and community betterment activities throughout the state . 
Miss Sally May Saabye , ( Miss Rhode Island 1960 ) says that within a short time -- on June 17th -- her reign will come to an end .

The State Ballet of Rhode Island Week proclamation by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor 
The ballet originated in Italy about 1450 . 
At that time it was a series of sophisticated social dances whose steps were often combined with other steps devised by the choreographer . 
Ballet flowered in Italy during the next hundred years , and about 1550 was carried to France when the Italian princess , Catherine De Medicis , married the King of France . 
The most famous ballet of that time was called Ballet Comique De La Reine ( 1581 ) . 
Dances alternated with sung or spoken verses . 
Ballets were used in opera from its beginning . 
They were placed either in the middle of the acts or in the intermissions . 
The State Ballet of Rhode Island , the first incorporated group , was formed for the purpose of extending knowledge of the art of ballet in the Community , to promote interest in ballet performances , to contribute to the cultural life of the State , and to provide opportunity for gifted dance students who , for one reason or another , are unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional state ; ; 
and now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim the week of Monday , November 13 , 1961 , as the State Ballet of Rhode Island Week , requesting all Rhode Islanders to give special attention to this unusual event which should contribute to the cultural life of the State . 
In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 23d day of October , in the year of Our Lord , one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one , and of Independence , the one hundred and eighty-sixth . 
Governor 
Proclamation Thanksgiving Day by John A. Notte , Jr. , Governor 
As another Thanksgiving draws near , let us take time out from the often hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled the hearts of the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving . 
The Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His benevolence during their first year in the new land . 
They had been through trying times , but their faith in the Almighty had given them the courage and the strength to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were the price they had to pay for freedom . 
And as the Pilgrims bowed their heads in humble gratitude , they shared another feeling -- the anticipation of what the future held for them and their posterity . 
They could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of hope to the oppressed countries of the world . 
They simply turned to God filled with gratitude and faith . 
We who are living today may learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first Thanksgiving Day . 
The Lord has shown time and time again His love for us . 
We have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we enjoy in this great country with the oppression and frugality of other nations to realize with humble gratitude that God's Providence has been with us since the very beginning of our country . 
And yet , accompanying our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial time . 
With world peace constantly being threatened , most of us regard the future skeptically , and even with fear . 
It is at this time that we should imitate the Pilgrims by accompanying our prayers of thanks with the conviction that we shall continue to be in dire need for the Lord's protection in the future , if we are to have peace ; ; 
now , therefore , do I , John A. Notte , Jr. , governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , proclaim Thursday , November 23rd , 1961 , as Thanksgiving Day , 
And so , let us remember on this day not only to thank the Almighty Who gave hope and courage to the Pilgrims , but also to place our trust in Him that He will continue to protect us in the future as He has in the past . 
In testimony whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21st day of November , in the year of Our Lord , one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of Independence , the one hundred and eighty-sixth .

In addition to maintaining a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases , wounds , and injuries of military importance , it provides facilities for clinical photography , photomicrography , and medical arts , and operates a printing plant , by permission of Congressional Committee , for publication of an `` Atlas of Tumor Pathology '' . 
It also maintains shops for the design and fabrication of exhibits , training aids and instruments and libraries for the loan of films and teaching lantern slide sets . 
2 . 
During this period , a total of 762 exhibits were presented at 442 medical and scientific meetings . 
Of these exhibits , 154 were newly constructed . 
Twenty-nine exhibits received awards . 
3 . 
Visual and operable training aids developed by the Medical Illustration Service , were used in support of Army Medical Service mass casualty exercises . 
Members of the Medical Illustration Service lectured and conducted demonstrations on the use of training aids to military personnel and various civilian medical organizations . 
Demonstrations of new and projected training aids were conducted at the Medical Service Instructor's Conference , Brooke Army Medical Center , Texas . 
4 . 
In support of the emphasis placed by the Department of Defense on instruction in emergency medical care , the Medical Illustration Service developed casualty simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins which are being field tested ; ; 
and overhead projector transparency sets on the subjects of Military Sanitation : First Aid For Soldiers ; ; 
Bandaging And Splinting ; ; 
The Emergency Medical Treatment Unit , Phase 1 ; ; 
and Emergency War Surgery in support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) Handbook . 
Fifty lantern slide teaching sets on the subject of `` Emergency War Surgery ( NATO ) '' were assembled and distributed to the Medical Military Services of foreign Governments associated with NATO and South-East Asia Treaty Organization . 
The British and Canadian Liaison Officers , as well as Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization , the American Red Cross , and similar interested organizations were informed from time to time as training aids were developed . 
5 . 
Nine veterinary lantern slide teaching sets were developed and distributed , and lantern slide teaching sets on 21 pathology subjects were added to the loan library of the Medical Illustration Service . 
Illustrations were prepared for 11 Department of the Army manuals and one Graphic Training Aid . 
Sixteen lantern slide sets were loaned to the Government of India and eight sets were forwarded to the U.S. Embassy , Managua , Nicaragua for the Educational Exchange Program . 
The Senate Subcommittee on Reorganization and International Organizations was provided samples of visual aids on first aid and personal health produced by the Medical Illustration Service . 
6 . 
Six fascicles ( 10,000 copies each ) of the `` Atlas Of Tumor Pathology '' were completed during the period of this report . 
The American Registry Of Pathology 
This consists of 25 individual registries , two of which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960 ( The Registry Of Forensic Pathology and The Testicular Tumor Registry ) . 
These registries are sponsored by 18 national medical , dental , and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural history of various diseases of military-medical importance . 
The American Registry Of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in medical research and education between the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international basis , under such conditions as may be agreed upon between the National Research Council and The Surgeons General of the Army , Navy , and Air Force . 
The staff utilized the collected material in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international meetings , exhibits , and published studies . 
During the period of this report , 37,470 new cases were entered into the various registries . 
These were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational purposes . 
In this same period , six new fascicles of the Atlas Of Tumor Pathology were published and distributed to medical centers world-wide . 
There were 54,320 copies of fascicles sold and 642 copies distributed free during this period . 
Forty-five new Clinico-pathologic Conferences were prepared , bringing the total to 61 available for loan distribution . 
Nine new teaching Clinico-pathologic Conference sets were prepared , which makes a total of 70 types of teaching sets for loan . 
During this period , 7,827 teaching sets were distributed on loan . 
The Clinico-pathologic Conferences have been acknowledged as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated military hospitals . 
The demand for teaching sets continues unabated since they provide the means for the military physicians to review the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior with structural changes . 
The Medical Museum 
In fiscal year 1959 , the Medical Museum was moved to Chase Hall , a temporary building on Independence Avenue at Ninth Street , Southwest , and continued to display to the public the achievements of the Armed Forces Medical Services . 
During the period of this report , 63 panel exhibits depicting the latest developments in medical research were displayed . 
Of the 375 exhibits ( of all types ) shown , 161 were new or refurbished . 
Of the 885 specimens newly mounted or refurbished , 254 were prepared for other agencies . 
Eighty-five specimens were loaned for study purposes . 
An exhibit , `` Macropathology -- An Ancient Art , A New Science '' , was presented at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association . 
A three-dimensional exhibit depicting `` A Century Of Naval Medicine '' was formally presented to The Director by George S. Squibb , great-grandson of the founder of E. R. Squibb and Sons , for permanent display in the Museum . 
Space was provided for short-time guest medical exhibits , and the Museum collected new accessions of microscopes , medical , surgical , and diagnostic instruments , uniform , and similar items of historical medico-military significance . 
During the period , the laboratory rendered centralized macropathological service to qualified requesters . 
Specimens were mounted for military installations , governmental agencies , and medical schools . 
Three hundred five copies of the Manual Of Macropathological Techniques were distributed . 
Thirty-five military and civilian students received laboratory training . 
During fiscal years 1959 and 1960 , there were 795,586 visitors to the Museum . 
During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961 , the Medical Museum was required to move to Temporary Building `` S '' on the Mall from Chase Hall . 
Throughout the period and during the movement operation , the Museum continued its functional support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology . 
Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency 
The Armed Forces Medical Publication Agency , established in 1949 , has published , since January 1950 , The United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice publication to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department officers of the three military services . 
Its supplement , The Medical Technicians Bulletin , supplied similar material to enlisted medical personnel . 
These publications replaced the U. S. Naval Medical Bulletin , published continuously from 1907 through 1959 , as well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of the U. S. Army Medical Department , published from 1922 to 1949 . 
In addition , their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin . 
Estimated annual savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin on a triservice basis , as compared with the cost of producing separate periodicals for each service , were between $65,000 and $70,000 . 
Additionally , on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations , the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the quantity now authorized , in order to provide any reasonably comparable coverage . 
From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960 , 24 numbers of the Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published . 
Each Journal contained articles of professional and clinical interest , and departments devoted to military medical news , reviews of new books , and other features of interest to officers of the medical services . 
The Council on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed a brief article to each issue entitled , `` This Is Your A.M.A. '' . 
Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal , the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was changed from varityping to hot typesetting . 
This resulted in an improved appearance , but was followed by an increase in printing cost that necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total of allocated funds . 
The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds . 
Two special issues were published , one for November 1959 on Space Medicine , the other the Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960 . 
The February 1960 issue marked the reinstitution of the section entitled , `` The Medical Officer Writes '' . 
Replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians Bulletin , publication of which was suspended with the November-December 1959 issue , a section called `` Technical Notes '' was inaugurated on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue . 
Occasional features were published on historical medicine , special reports , bibliography , and `` Collector's Items '' . 
In May 1960 , the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the `` Medical Museum '' , and in June , the Institute started contributing a regular monthly `` Case For Diagnosis '' . 
The Institute also planned to furnish a regular series of articles , beginning in the fall of 1960 , on its more significant Scientific Exhibits . 
The Armed Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report for one of its 12 commissions , so that each commission will report once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces . 
The first report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue of the Journal . 
Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product is relatively non-volatile . 
This work gave a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method , and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago . 
Similar measurements are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product , beryllium fluoride . 
The development and testing of new apparatus to measure other properties is nearing completion . 
In one of these , an exploding-wire device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 Af and 100 atmospheres pressure , a major goal was achieved . 
The accuracy of measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 percent . 
This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals . 
The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element as a calorimeter . 
The element is inserted in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire , and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy . 
This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the element and the measured voltage across the element . 
A high-speed shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion . 
The shutter consists of two parts : a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part . 
Using Edgerton's method , the fast-closing action is obtained from the blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires . 
The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil ( approximately Af ) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera . 
The opening action is obtained when a capacitor , charged to high voltage , is suddenly discharged through the foil . 
During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward its center line , thus allowing light to pass into the camera . 
Experiments have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds . 
The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil . 
Laboratory measurements of interstellar radio spectra . 
Besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength , the spectra of extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic of other atoms , ions , and small molecules . 
The detection and study of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas clouds and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres . 
Among the most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light diatomic hydrides OH and CH ; ; 
somewhat less likely sources are the heavier hydrides SH , SiH , and Aj . 
Very small concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable ; ; 
in interstellar gas , concentrations as low as Af molecules per Af may be sufficient , as compared to the Af hydrogen atom's Af required for detection of the 21-cm line . 
High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver ; ; 
therefore , only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible . 
To secure precise measurements of these frequencies , a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy has been started . 
Since conventional methods are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions , the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead . 
This involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor , which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave range , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity . 
The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance method was the OH radical . 
Results of this experiment include the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas ; ; 
the frequencies are 1665.32 and 1667.36 Af , with an uncertainty of 0.10 Af . 
Success in observing these spectral lines has so far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory ; ; 
extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported . 
Preparations are being made for similar experiments on CH and SH radicals . 
Low temperature thermometry . 
The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 Af . 
The efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories : absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas , secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors , and helium-4 vapor-pressure measurements ( see p. 144 ) . 
Acoustical interferometer . 
An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and used , with helium gas as the thermometric fluid , to measure temperatures near 4.2 and 2.1 Af . 
Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute temperature measurement , and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer . 
When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium-4 vapor pressures , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found . 
This result is preliminary , and work is continuing . 
Resistance thermometers . 
Carbon resistors and impurity-doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region . 
Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 Af and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium . 
Preliminary calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 Af at every 0.1 Af . 
The estimated standard deviations of the data for two of the resistors were 1 millidegree ; ; 
and for the third resistor , 3.3 millidegrees . 
Vapor pressure method . 
The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a `` constant temperature '' liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 Af . 
Surface temperature gradients have been found to exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15- and 25-liter metallic storage dewars . 
The gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 Af but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly greater than the **yl point . 
A hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium . 
However , the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate the tube ( which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb ) from the liquid helium surface . 
It has also been observed , in helium 2 , that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer . 
This has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer . 
In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified to reduce the helium film flow . 
Pressure transducer for pvt measurements . 
Precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer . 
A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and thoroughly tested . 
The transducer is a null-type instrument and employs a stretched diaphragm , 0.001 in. thick and 1 in. in diameter . 
A small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 0.001 in. apart ( for Af ) . 
Spherical concave backing surfaces support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit . 
Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 Af and at pressures up to 250 atm , an overload of 300 psi , applied for a period of one day , results in an uncertainty in the pressure of , at most , one millimeter of mercury . 
Transport properties of air . 
A 6-year study of the transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed . 
This project was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command , U.S. Air Force , and had as its goal the investigation of the transport by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding . 
A significant effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation region . 
Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present . 
The results of the study , based on collision integrals computed from the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air , will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity , thermal conductivity , thermal diffusion , and diffusion coefficients at temperatures of 1,000 to 10,000 Af and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from Af to Af times normal density . 
International cooperative activities . 
In March , 1961 , representatives of the national laboratories of Australia , Canada , The Netherlands , United Kingdom , U.S.S.R. , United States , and West Germany , met at the NBS to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature scale between 10 and 90 Af . 
As a first step toward this goal , arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers for calibration by each national laboratory . 
Such a group of thermometers was obtained and calibrated at the Aj . 
These thermometers have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National Physical Laboratory . 
Temperature symposium . 
During the last week of march 1961 , Columbus , Ohio was the site of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature , Its Measurement And Control In Science And Industry . 
The Symposium , which was jointly sponsored by the American Institute of Physics , the Instrument Society of America , and the National Bureau of Standards , attracted nearly one thousand registrants , including many from abroad . 
The Bureau contributed to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr. W. A. Wildhack , General Chairman , and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld , Program Chairman . 
Dr. A. V. Astin , NBS Director , opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks , following which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week by NBS scientists , from both the Washington and Boulder Laboratories . 
2.1.6 . 
Atomic physics 
In addition to the basic programs in wavelength standards , spectroscopy , solid state physics , interactions of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to provide the foundation for technological progress , the Bureau has strengthened its activities in laboratory astrophysics . 
The programs in infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards in the far infrared , the application of infrared techniques to solid state studies , and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation . 
Two data centers have been established for the collection , indexing , critical evaluation , and dissemination of bibliographies and critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision cross sections . 
Laboratory astrophysics . 
Transition probabilities . 
Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research and the Advanced Research Projects Agency , a data center was established to gather and index all published information on atomic transition probabilities . 
An exhaustive survey was made of the literature , and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued . 
Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now in preparation . 
A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen and oxygen . 
This apparatus will also be used to measure transition probabilities of a large number of other elements . 
A study of the hydrogen line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable to about Af percent . 
A set of tables containing spectral intensities for 39,000 lines of 70 elements , as observed in a copper matrix in a d-c arc , was completed and published . 
Studies of the intensity data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition probabilities . 
These data are not of the precision obtainable by the methods previously mentioned , but the vast number of approximate values available will be useful in many areas . 
Atomic energy levels . 
Research continues on the very complex spectra of the rare earth elements . 
New computer and automation techniques were applied to these spectra with considerable success .

Mr. Dooley . 
Mr. Speaker , for several years now the commuter railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population wants and is entitled to have . 
The causes of the decline of the commuter railroads are many and complex -- high taxes , losses of revenue to Government subsidized highway and air carriers , to name but two . 
And the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service . 
There have been a number of sound plans proposed . 
But none of these has been implemented . 
Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter railroad service decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand . 
Though the number of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased tremendously since World War 2 , , total annual rail commutation dropped 124 million for 1947 to 1957 . 
Nowhere has this decline been more painfully evident than in the New York City area . 
Here the New York Central Railroad , one of the Nation's most important carriers , has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949 . 
At this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads , a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has appeared in the form of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad's proposal for control of the Baltimore & Ohio railroads . 
The New York Central has pointed out that this control , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission , would give the combined C. & O. - B. & O. Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the New York Central . 
Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful , but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area . 
The New York Central notes : `` 
The freight traffic most susceptible to raiding by the C. & O. - B. & O. provides the backbone of Central's revenues . 
These revenues make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter and terminal freight services . 
If these services are to be maintained , the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible '' . 
The New York Central today handles 60 percent of all southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City . 
This is a $14 million operation involving 3,500 employees who work on commuter traffic exclusively . 
A blow to this phase of the Central's operations would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad itself , but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient , reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city . 
`` 
There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful C. & O. - B. & O. merger scheme '' -- 
The Central has pointed out . 
`` 
The logic of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious that B. & O. was publicly committed to the approach outlined here . 
Detailed studies of the plan were well underway . 
Though far from completion , these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads concerned , their investors , their customers , their users , and to the public at large . 
Then , abandoning the studies in the face of their promising outlook for all concerned , B. & O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations with C. & O. which resulted in the present situation . 
In the light of the facts at hand , however , New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest '' . 
The Interstate Commerce Commission will commence its deliberations on the proposed C. & O. - B. & O. merger on June 18 . 
Obviously , the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge . 
However , there is a more profound consideration to this proposed merger than profit and loss . 
That is , will it serve the long-range public interest ? ? 
For the past 40 years Congress has advocated a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway system . 
We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter -- the two-way B. & O. - C. & O. merger , or the three-way New York Central - B. & O. - C. & O. merger . 
Which will serve not only the best interest of the stockholders , but the interests of all the traveling public ? ? 
Mr. Lindsay . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to a great newspaper , the New York Times , on the occasion of a major change in its top executive command . 
Arthur Hays Sulzberger has been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American journalism on the occasion of his retirement . 
I am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the board of the New York Times . 
Mr. Sulzberger's successor as publisher is Mr. Orvil E. Dryfoos , who is president of the New York Times Co. , and who has been with the Times since 1942 . 
Mr. Dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's great newspapers will be maintained . 
I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes , a member of the Times staff since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page editor . 
Mr. Oakes succeeds Charles Merz , editor since 1938 , who now becomes editor emeritus . 
I should like at this time , Mr. Speaker , to pay warm tribute to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism . 
My heartiest congratulations go to their successors , Orvil E. Dryfoos and John B. Oakes , who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition of the New York Times . 
The people of the 17th District of New York , and I as their Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers of the world . 
Mr. Stratton . 
Mr. Speaker , in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine . 
Yesterday , I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article in the U.S. News & World Report of May 8 which discussed this type of action in more detail , including both its advantages and its disadvantages . 
Under leave to extend my remarks , I include the relevant portion of my newsletter , together with the text of the article from the U.S. News & World Report : `` your Congressman , Samuel S. Stratton , reports from Washington , May 1 , 1961 
. 
Cuban S.S.R. : Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week , there was at least one positive benefit , and that was the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated military base . 
In fact , one of the major reasons for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian military equipment . 
Somehow , the pictures and stories of Soviet T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark , blunt truth of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from home . 
Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of the United States , violate the Monroe Doctrine , and threaten the security of every other Latin American republic . 
Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone . 
But the Latin American republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board . 
For years the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude Castro's representative from secret military talks . 
But it took the pictures of the Migs and the T-34 tanks to do the job . 
There is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week . 
You can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; ; 
efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past . 
What the next move will be only time , of course , will tell . 
Personally , I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba . 
We simply can't tolerate further Russian weapons , including the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles , being located in Cuba . 
Obviously , we can't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk . 
A naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine , would be a relatively simple operation to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere '' . 
`` 
( from U.s. News & World Report , May 8 , 1961 ) 
next for Cuba : an arms blockade ? ? 
Look at Castro now -- cockier than ever with arms and agents to threaten the Americas . 
How can the United States act ? ? 
Blockade is one answer offered by experts . 
In it they see a way to isolate Cuba , stop infiltration , maybe finish Castro , too . 
This is the question now facing President Kennedy : How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere ? ? 
On April 25 , the White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U.S. trade with Cuba was being considered . 
Its aim : To undermine further Cuba's economy . 
Weaken Castro . 
Another strategy -- bolder and tougher -- was also attracting notice in Washington : a naval and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world , destroy Castro . 
Blockade , in the view of military and civilian experts , could restore teeth to the Monroe Doctrine . 
It could halt a flood of Communist arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro . 
It could stop Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America . 
It would be the most severe reprisal , short of declared war , that the United States could invoke against Castro . 
It is the strategy of blockade , therefore , that is suddenly at the center of attention of administration officials , Members of Congress , officers in the Pentagon . 
As a possible course of action , it also is the center of debate and is raising many questions . 
Among these questions : what would a Cuba blockade take ? ? 
Military experts say a tight naval blockade off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces , each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers . 
The Navy , on April 25 , announced it is bringing back the carrier Shangri-La from the Mediterranean , increasing to four the number of attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba . 
More than 36 other big Navy ships are no less than a day's sailing time away . 
To round out the blockading force , submarines would be needed -- to locate , identify and track approaching vessels . 
Land-based radar would help with this task . 
So would radar picket ships . 
A squadron of Navy jets and another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier task forces . 
Three requirements go with a blockade : It must be proclaimed ; ; 
the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce it ; ; 
and it must be enforced without discrimination . 
Once these conditions of international law are met , countries that try to run the blockade do so at their own risk . 
Blockade runners can be stopped -- by gunfire , if necessary -- searched and held , at least temporarily . 
They could be sent to U.S. ports for rulings whether cargo should be confiscated . 
What could a blockade accomplish ? ? 
Plenty , say the experts . 
In a broad sense , it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere . 
It could , by avoiding direct intervention , provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration . 
Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia . 
Shipments of arms from Western countries could similarly be seized as contraband . 
In a total blockade , action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs . 
At times , three ships a day from the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports . 
From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236 , 66th Congress , the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States , by means of grants-in-aid , to return disabled men and women to productive , gainful employment . 
The authority for the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation program was made permanent as Title 5 , of the Social Security Act in 1935 . 
Up to this time and for the next eight years , the services provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training , counseling , and placement on a job . 
Recognizing the limitations of such a program , the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P. L. 113 , which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities , and which revised the financing structure . 
Recent changes . 
Despite the successful rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943 , the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million disabled . 
To assist the States , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities '' , the 83rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 ( P. L. 565 ) . 
These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation facilities , for more sheltered and `` half-way '' workshops , for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel , for more comprehensive services to individuals ( particularly to the homebound and the blind ) , and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's overall effectiveness . 
Financial aspects . 
Under the law as it existed until 1943 , the Federal Government made grants to the States on the basis of population , matching State expenditures on a 50-50 basis . 
Under P. L. 113 , 78th Congress , the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled , and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services . 
Throughout these years , the statutory authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act . 
The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program , providing for a three-part grant structure -- for ( 1 ) basic support ; ; 
( 2 ) extension and improvement ; ; 
and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation -- and in addition for short-term training and instruction . 
The first part of the new structure -- that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation services -- is described in this Section . 
Subsequent sections on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure . 
The following table shows , for selected years , the authorizations , appropriations , allotment base , Federal grants to States and State matching funds for this part of the grant program : 
method of distributing funds 
description of formula . 
In order to assist the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services , Section 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for support of such services be based on ( 1 ) need , as measured by a State's population , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity , as measured by its per capita income . 
The Act further provides for a `` floor '' or minimum allotment , set at the 1954 level , which is called the `` base '' allotment , and a `` ceiling '' or maximum allotment , for each State . 
It stipulates , in addition , that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing the `` ceiling '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor '' , be redistributed to those States still below their maximums . 
These provisions are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among the States , with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populated State . 
The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already in operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone . 
Method of computing allotments . 
The method used in computing the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act . 
The term `` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ; 
the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia , and excludes the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii . 
The following steps are employed in calculations : 1 . 
For each State ( except Puerto Rico , Guam , the Virgin Islands , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) determine average per capita income based on the last three years . 
( See Source of Data , below for per capita income data to be used in this step . 
) 2 . 
Determine the average per capita income for the U. S. based on the last three years . 
( See Source of Data , below , for per capita income data to be used in this step . 
) 3 . 
Determine the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U. S. ( Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above . 
) 4 . 
Determine for each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U. S. . 
( Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained for each State in item 1 above . 
) 5 . 
Determine the particular State's `` allotment percentage '' . 
By law this is 75% for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico . 
( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 . 
) 
In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ; 
except that no State shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-1/3% nor more than 75% . 
If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes , the State's allotment percentage must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme . 
6 . 
Square each State's allotment percentage . 
7 . 
Determine each State's population . 
( See Source of Data , below for population data to be used in this step . 
) 8 . 
Multiply the population of each State by the square of its allotment percentage . 
( Multiply result obtained in item 7 above , by result obtained in item 6 above . 
) 9 . 
Determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above , for all the States . 
( For each State , make all computations set forth in items 1 to 8 above , and then add the results obtained for each State in item 8 . 
) 10 . 
Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted is to the sum of the products for all the States . 
( Divide the amount being allotted by the result obtained in item 9 above . 
) 11 . 
Determine the particular State's unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year . 
( Multiply the State product in item 8 above by the result obtained in item 10 above . 
) 12 . 
Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is greater than its maximum allotment , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment . 
( Each State's unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year , which exceeds its minimum allotment described in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23,000,000 , must be reduced by the amount of the excess . 
) 13 . 
Determine if the particular State's unadjusted allotment ( result obtained in item 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment to its minimum allotment . 
Regardless of its unadjusted allotment , each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954 -- increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000 . 
14 . 
The funds recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment ( item 13 above ) ; ; 
and second , to increase uniformly the allotments to those States whose allotments are below their maximums , with adjustments to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum . 
Additional note on allotments . 
For the States which maintain two separate agencies -- one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind , and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind -- the Act specifies that their minimum ( base ) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954 . 
Funds allotted in addition to their minimum allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine . 
Matching requirements 
explanation of matching formula . 
As is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational rehabilitation services , the matching requirements are also based on a statutory formula . 
Prior to 1960 , in order to provide matching for the minimum ( base ) allotment , State funds had to equal 1954 State funds . 
Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State , with a pivot of 40% State ( or 60% Federal ) participation in total program costs . 
The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any State is referred to in the law as that State's `` Federal share '' . 
For purposes of this explanation , this percentage is referred to as the State's `` unadjusted Federal share '' . 
Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) 25% a year , so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot State share , with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and 30% , respectively . 
The pre-1960 rate of Federal participation with respect to any State's base allotment , as well as the adjusted rate in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period , is designated by the statute as that State's `` adjusted Federal Share '' . 
The provisions for determining a State's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the varying financial resources among the States . 
The purpose of the adjusted Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition provisions for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates . 
Method of computing Federal shares . 
The method used for computing the respective Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set forth in the Act . 
The term `` State '' means the several States , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico ; ; 
the term `` United States '' includes the several States and the District of Columbia and excludes the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii . 
The following steps are employed in the calculations : 1 . 
For each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , determine the average per capita income for the last three years . 
( the same amount used in item 1 under Method Of Computing Allotments , above . 
) 2 . 
Determine the average per capita income for the United States for the last three years . 
( The same amount used in item 2 under Method Of Computing Allotments , above . 
) 3 . 
Determine the ratio of 40% to the average per capita income of the United States . 
( Divide 40 by the amount used in item 2 above . 
) 4 . 
Determine for each State ( except the Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska and Hawaii ) , that percentage which bears the same ration to 40% as the particular State's average per capita income bears to the average per capita income of the United States . 
( Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above . 
) 5 . 
Determine the particular State's `` Federal Share '' . 
By law this is 70% for the Virgin Islands , Guam and Puerto Rico . 
( Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 . 
) 
In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above ; ; 
except that no State shall have a Federal share less than 50% nor more than 70% . 
If the resulting difference for the particular State is less or more than these extremes , the State's Federal share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme . 
At the entrance side of the shelter , each roof beam is rested on the inside 4 inches of the block wall . 
The outside 4-inch space is filled by mortaring blocks on edge . 
The wooden bracing between the roof beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall . 
Mortar is poured between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shielding . 
( For details see inset , fig. 5 . 
) 
The first one or two roof boards ( marked `` E '' in fig. 6 ) are slipped into place across the roof beams , from outside the shelter . 
These boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up through the open space between the beams , from inside the shelter . 
Concrete blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards . 
The roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together . 
Work on the roof continues in this way . 
The last roof boards are covered with blocks from outside the shelter . 
When the roof blocks are all in place , the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position . 
The structure is complete . 
( See fig. 7 . 
) Building plans are on page 21 . 
Solid concrete blocks , relatively heavy and dense , are used for this shelter . 
These blocks are sold in various sizes so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit . 
Solid blocks are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete to give effective protection . 
Bricks are an alternative . 
If they are used , the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks . 
The illustrations in fig. 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall . 
More detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply houses and craftsmen . 
Other sources of information include the National Concrete Masonry Association , 38 South Dearborn Street , Chicago , Ill. , the Portland Cement Association , 33 West Grand Avenue , Chicago , Ill. , and the Structural Clay Products Association , Washington , D.C. . 
Aboveground double-wall shelter 
An outdoor , aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete blocks . 
( See fig. 9 , double-wall shelter . 
) Most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter . 
Plans are on pages 22 and 23 . 
This shelter could be built in regions where water or rock is close to the surface , making it impractical to build an underground shelter . 
Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed at least 20 inches apart . 
The space between them is filled with pit-run gravel or earth . 
The walls are held together with metal ties placed in the wet mortar as the walls are built . 
The roof shown here ( fig. 9 ) is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete , covered with at least 20 inches of pit-run gravel . 
An alternate roof , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof beams , overlaid with boards and waterproofing . 
It would have to be covered with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel . 
The materials for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700 . 
Contractors' charges would be additional . 
The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection . 
Pre-shaped metal shelter 
Pre-shaped corrugated metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either above or below ground . 
These are particularly suitable for regions where water or rock is close to the surface . 
They form effective fallout shelters when mounded over with earth , as shown in figure 10 . 
Materials for this shelter would cost about $700 . 
A contractor probably would be required to help build it . 
His charges would be added to the cost of materials . 
This shelter , as shown on page 24 , would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation . 
An alternate hatchway entrance , shown on page 25 , would reduce the cost of materials $50 to $100 . 
The National Lumber Manufacturers Association , Washington , D. C. , is developing plans to utilize specially treated lumber for underground shelter construction . 
The Structural Clay Products Institute , Washington , D.C. , is working to develop brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction . 
Underground concrete shelter 
An underground reinforced concrete shelter can be built by a contractor for about $1,000 to $1,500 , depending on the type of entrance . 
The shelter shown would provide almost absolute fallout protection . 
The illustration ( fig. 11 ) shows this shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over . 
The same shelter could be built into an embankment or below ground level . 
Plans for the shelter , with either a stairway or hatchway entrance , are shown on pages 26 and 27 . 
Another type of shelter which gives excellent fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement of a home under construction . 
It would add about $500 to the total cost of the home . 
The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such a room built in a new home in the Washington , D.C. area in the Spring of 1959 . 
Important considerations common to each type of shelter are : 1 . 
Arrangement of the entrance . 
2 . 
Ventilation . 
3 . 
Radio reception . 
4 . 
Lighting . 
The entrance must have at least one right-angle turn . 
Radiation scatters somewhat like light . 
Some will go around a corner . 
The rest continues in a straight line . 
Therefore , sharp turns in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter . 
Ventilation is provided in a concrete block basement shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance . 
A blower may be installed to increase comfort . 
A blower is essential for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters . 
It should provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person . 
Vent pipes also are necessary ( as shown in figs. 9 , 10 , and 11 ) , but filters are not . 
Radio reception is cut down by the shielding necessary to keep out radiation . 
As soon as the shelter is completed a radio reception check must be made . 
It probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna , particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts . 
Lighting is an important consideration . 
Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere flashlight-type bulb . 
Tests have shown that such a device , with a fresh battery , will furnish light continuously for at least 10 days . 
With a spare battery , a source of light for 2 weeks or more would be assured . 
A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those periods when a brighter light is needed . 
There should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue in many areas . 
Other considerations . 
-- If there are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter , they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 . 
Other basement windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens . 
Basement walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the Appendix , page 29 . 
In these shelters the entrance should be not more than 2 feet wide . 
Bunks , or materials to build them , may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed . 
The basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection . 
3 . 
Living in a shelter 
The radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first . 
Forty-nine hours after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent of what it was an hour after the explosion . 
But the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous . 
Therefore , civil defense instructions received over CONELRAD or by other means should be followed . 
A battery-powered radio is essential . 
Radiation instruments suitable for home use are available , and would be of value in locating that portion of the home which offers the best protection against fallout radiation . 
There is a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters may become available . 
One instrument thus would serve both purposes . 
Your local civil defense will gather its own information and will receive broad information from State and Federal sources . 
It will tell you as soon as possible : 
How long to stay in your shelter ; ; 
How soon you may go outdoors ; ; 
How long you may stay outside . 
You should be prepared to stay in your shelter full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 days or longer . 
A checklist in the Appendix ( ( page 30 ) tells what is needed . 
Families with children will have particular problems . 
They should provide for simple recreation . 
There should be a task for everyone and these tasks should be rotated . 
Part of the family should be sleeping while the rest is awake . 
To break the monotony it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy . 
Records such as diaries can be kept . 
The survival of the family will depend largely on information received by radio . 
A record should be kept of the information and instructions , including the time and date of broadcast . 
Family rationing probably will be necessary . 
Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule . 
There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement . 
However , as much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum . 
The housekeeping problems of living in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied . 
Food , medical supplies , utensils , and equipment , if not already stored in the shelter , must be quickly gathered up and carried into it . 
After the family has settled in the shelter , the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge . 
Sanitation in the confines of the family shelter will require much thought and planning . 
Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human wastes will be an unfamiliar problem . 
A covered container such as a kitchen garbage pail might do as a toilet . 
A 10-gallon garbage can , with a tightly fitting cover , could be used to keep the wastes until it is safe to leave the shelter . 
Water rationing will be difficult and should be planned carefully . 
A portable electric heater is advisable for shelters in cold climates . 
It would take the chill from the shelter in the beginning . 
Even if the electric power fails after an attack , any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter that much more comfortable . 
Body heat in the close quarters will help keep up the temperature . 
Warm clothing and bedding , of course , are essential . 
Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided . 
A flame would use up air . 
Some families already have held weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need . 
4 . 
If an attack finds you without a prepared shelter 
Few areas , if any , are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about . 
A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding from fallout radiation . 
On the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it is outside . 
The best protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house . 
A belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level . 
The safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows and deepest below ground . 
If there is time after the warning , the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking windows with bricks , dirt , books , magazines , or other heavy material . 
5 . 
Shelter in apartment buildings 
Large apartment buildings of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual family dwellings . 
In general , such apartments afford more protection than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is more space . 
The central area of the ground floor of a heavily constructed apartment building , with concrete floors , should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling . 
The basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended for the basement of a family dwelling . 
The Federal Government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential , commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout protection they would provide , and for how many people . 
The problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use of existing space . 
Such planning will require the cooperation of other occupants and of the apartment management . 
A former Du Pont official became a General Motors vice president and set about maximizing Du Pont's share of the General Motors market . 
Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several Du Pont products were actively promoted . 
Within a few years various Du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire requirements of from four to seven of General Motors' eight operating divisions . 
The Fisher Body division , long controlled by the Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned a majority of its stock , followed an independent course for many years , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance had collapsed '' and its purchases from Du Pont `` compared favorably '' with purchases by other General Motors divisions . 
Competitors came to receive higher percentage of General Motors business in later years , but it is `` likely '' that this trend stemmed `` at least in part '' from the needs of General Motors outstripping Du Pont's capacity . 
`` 
The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of Du Pont's production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to Du Pont by a stock interest . 
The inference is overwhelming that Du Pont's commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained solely on competitive merit '' . 
353 U. S. , at 605 . 
This Court agreed with the trial court `` that considerations of price , quality and service were not overlooked by either Du Pont or General Motors '' . 
353 U. S. , at 606 . 
However , it determined that neither this factor , nor `` the fact that all concerned in high executive posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly , each in the honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own company and without any design to overreach anyone , including Du Pont's competitors '' , outweighed the Government's claim for relief . 
This claim , as submitted to the District Court and dismissed by it , 126 F.Supp.235 , alleged violation not only of 7 of the Clayton Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act . 
The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade . 
However , this Court put to one side without consideration the Government's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman Act allegations . 
It rested its decision solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part : `` 
No corporation engaged in commerce shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in commerce , where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition , or to restrain such commerce in any section or community , or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce . 
This section shall not apply to corporations purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about , or in attempting to bring about , the substantial lessening of competition . 
'' 
The purpose of this provision was thus explained in the Court's opinion : `` 
Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation , but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies in a relevant market which , as a reasonable probability , appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation . 
The section is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies , or the substantial lessening of competition , have occurred or are intended . 
'' 353 U. S. , at 589 . 
Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's decision . 
Indeed , as already noted , the Court proceeded on the assumption that the executives involved in the dealings between Du Pont and General Motors acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests of their own companies . 
This , however , did not bar finding that Du Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and finishes to General Motors ; ; 
that these products constituted a `` line of commerce '' within the meaning of the Clayton Act ; ; 
that General Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial ; ; 
and that competition for this share of the market was endangered by the financial relationship between the two concerns : `` 
The statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned by the statute . 
We repeat , that the test of a violation of 7 is whether , at the time of suit , there is a reasonable probability that the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints . 
The conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved as to this acquisition . 
'' 353 U. S. , at 607 . 
On the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion , the Court remanded the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate relief . 
The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed to it was this : `` 
The judgment must therefore be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination , after further hearing , of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition offensive to the statute . 
The District Courts , in the framing of equitable decrees , are clothed ' with large discretion to model their judgements to fit the exigencies of the particular case . 
International Salt Co. v. United States , 332 U. S. 392 , 400-401 '' . 
353 U. S. , at 607-608 . 
This brings us to the course of the proceedings in the District Court . 
2 . 
This Court's judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18 , 1957 . 
The first pretrial conference -- held to appoint amici curiae to represent the interest of the stockholders of Du Pont and General Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent hearings -- took place on September 25 , 1957 . 
At the outset , the Government's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government and for Du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court . 
Du Pont , he said , had proposed disenfranchisement of its General Motors stock along with other restrictions on the Du Pont - General Motors relationship . 
The Government , deeming these suggestions inadequate , had urged that any judgment include divestiture of Du Pont's shares of General Motors . 
Counsel for the Government invited Du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program , but stated that if the court desired , or if counsel for Du Pont thought further discussion would not be profitable , the Government was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days . 
Counsel for Du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by both sides at an early date . 
No previous antitrust case , he said , had involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems of relief . 
The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the abstract . 
The Court adopted this procedure with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out . 
The Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25 , 1957 . 
The plan called for divestiture by Du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders , as a dividend , over a period of ten years . 
Christiana Securities Company and Delaware Realty & Investment Company , major stockholders in Du Pont , and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee , again over a ten-year period , of Du Pont's General Motors stock allocable to them , as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware owned outright . 
If , in the trustee's judgment , `` reasonable market conditions '' did not prevail during any given year , he was to be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the ten-year period . 
In addition , the right to vote the General Motors stock held by Du Pont was to be vested in Du Pont's stockholders , other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; ; 
Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General Motors ; ; 
Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with General Motors , and vice versa ; ; 
and General Motors and Du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any Du Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent rights , or for a grant by General Motors to Du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies . 
On motion of the Amici Curiae , the court directed that a ruling be obtained from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax consequences of the Government's plan . 
On May 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner announced his rulings . 
The annual dividends paid to Du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of Du Pont's earnings and profits . 
The measure , for federal income tax purposes , of the dividend to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution . 
In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value of the shares or Du Pont's tax basis for them , which is approximately $2.09 per share . 
The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned by or allocable to Christiana , Delaware , and the stockholders of Delaware , and deposited with the trustee , would result in a tax to those parties at the capital gains rate . 
Du Pont's counterproposal was filed on May 14 , 1958 . 
Under its plan Du Pont would retain its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders the right to vote those shares . 
Christiana and Delaware would , in turn , be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors shares allocable to them to their own stockholders . 
Du Pont would be enjoined from having as a director , officer , or employee anyone who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors , and no director , officer , or employee of Du Pont could serve as a director of General Motors without court approval . 
Du Pont would be denied the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except through General Motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights to its stockholders . 
On June 6 , 1958 , General Motors submitted its objections to the Government's proposal . 
It argued , inter alia , that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and Du Pont , with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors , among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions ; ; 
that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks , with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies ; ; 
that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital ; ; 
and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity . 
General Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would not be `` in the public interest '' as required by the mandate of this Court . 
The decrees proposed by the amici curiae were filed in August of 1958 . 
These plans , like Du Pont's , contained provisions for passing the vote on Du Pont's General Motors shares on to the ultimate stockholders of Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , except that officers and directors of the three companies , their spouses , and other people living in their households , as well as other specified persons , were to be totally disenfranchised . 
Both plans also prohibited common directors , officers , or employees between Du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware , on the one hand , and General Motors on the other . 
It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship . 
While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage . 
By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U.S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection . 
One need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself . 
One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage . 
The Court's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrones an unreality into a rule of law '' . 
I am not easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries can be so lightly dismissed . 
But in any event , I submit that the power to depose belongs to Congress , not to this Court . 
I dissent . 
Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious objector , was convicted of violating 12a of the Universal Military Training and Service Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces . 
He claims that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice , he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed to him by the local board , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim . 
Held : On the record in this case , the administrative procedures prescribed by the Act were fully complied with ; ; 
petitioner was not denied due process ; ; 
and his conviction is sustained . 
Pp. 60-66 . 
( A ) 
Petitioner was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings , because the statement in question was in his file , to which he had access , and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board . 
Pp. 62-63 . 
( B ) 
Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's notes and report , especially since he failed to show any particular need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of Justice's recommendation to the appeal board . 
Pp. 63-64 . 
( C ) 
Petitioner was not entitled , either in the administrative hearing at the Department of Justice or at his trial , to inspect the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , since he was furnished a resume of it , did not challenge its accuracy , and showed no particular need for the original report . 
Pp. 64-66 . 
Haydn C. Covington argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner . 
Daniel M. Friedman argued the cause for the United States . 
On the brief were Solicitor General Rankin , Assistant Attorney General Wilkey , Beatrice Rosenberg and J. F. Bishop . 
Mr. Justice Clark delivered the opinion of the Court . 
This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the armed services , in violation of the provisions of the Universal Military Training and Service Act , 62 Stat. 604,622 , 50 , U.S.C. App. Aj 462 ( A ) . 
Petitioner , who claims to be a conscientious objector , contends that he was denied due process , both in the proceedings before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at trial . 
He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer statements attributed to him by the local board , and , further , that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim -- all in violation of the Fifth Amendment . 
The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require the production of such documents . 
Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment . 
The Court of Appeals affirmed . 
269 F. 2d 613 . 
We granted certiorari in view of the importance of the questions in the administration of the Act . 
361 U. S. 899 . 
We have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale of Gonzales v. United States , 348 U.S. 407 ( 1955 ) , and United States v. Nugent , 346 U.S. 1 ( 1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment . 
Petitioner registered with Local Board No. 9 , Boulder , Colorado , on March 17 , 1952 . 
His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah's Witnesses , employed at night by a sugar producer . 
He claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching . 
On November 13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class 1-a . 
On November 22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board , protesting this classification . 
He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; ; 
that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form . 
Thereafter he was classified 1-o . 
On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board . 
In a periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home . 
Upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so . 
He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella v. United States , 348 U.S. 385 ( 1955 ) . 
He was again reclassified 1-a by the local board . 
There followed a customary Department of Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared . 
In his report to the Attorney General , the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service . 
On March 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1-a classification . 
Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions . 
It reported that he now devoted only some 6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities . 
His claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good faith '' . 
The appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation . 
In his answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering '' was in 1952 . 
The appeal board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department's recommendation . 
Upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so . 
Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching . 
But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file . 
He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer . 
This he failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file . 
Apparently he never took the trouble to find out . 
Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board . 
After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board , that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial . 
This he did . 
We found in Gonzales v. United States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant . 
We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut ( the Department's ) recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' . 
348 U.S. , at 412 . 
We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's contention , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it . 
As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact . 
Estep v. United States , 327 U.S. 114 '' . 
348 U. S. , at 412-413 . 
But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult . 
At his trial , petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the Department's hearing officer , Evensen , as well as his report thereon . 
Petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice . 
He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; ; 
nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose . 
Section 6(j) of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department's recommendation to be placed in a registrant's file . 
Gonzales v. United States , supra . 
But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant . 
While the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the registrant's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 . 
Moreover , the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney General and , of course , is not the recommendation of the Department . 
It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice , of which the Attorney General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection . 
It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board . 
It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board . 
Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board . 
Petitioner knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file . 
Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed . 
It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial . 
In addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes . 
While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process . 
Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts . 
In the light of these circumstances , as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's report and notes . 
Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial . 
He did receive a resume of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its inaccuracy . 
Even now no such claim is asserted . 
He bases his present contention on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume . 
But this is fully answered by United States v. Nugent , supra . 
There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection '' . 
346 U.S. , at 5-6 . 
Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report . 
The recommendation of the Department -- as well as the decision of the appeal board -- was based entirely on the local board file , not on an FBI report . 
Foreign policy in its total context 
With this enlarged role in mind , I should like to make a few suggestions : What we in the United States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happens in the rest of the world . 
We in this Department must think about foreign policy in its total context . 
We cannot regard foreign policy as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy has been extracted . 
Foreign policy is the total involvement of the American people with peoples and governments abroad . 
That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership , we must think in terms of the total context of our situation . 
It is the concern of the Department of State that the American people are safe and secure -- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense . 
It is also the concern of the Department of State that our trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous , profitable , and active -- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of concern only to the Department of Commerce . 
We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences between this and other departments . 
Assistant Secretaries of State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination of policies . 
Means must be found to enable us to keep in touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues in other departments concerned with foreign policy . 
I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action . 
Every policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer . 
Unless we keep our eyes on the horizon ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present . 
The movement of events is so fast , the pace so severe , that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are to think accurately about the present . 
If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of our affairs . 
Action taken today is often far more valuable than action taken several months later in response to a situation then out of control . 
There will of course be times for delay and inaction . 
What I am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties . 
I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas -- an affliction of all bureaucracies . 
We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom to the top of the Department . 
We want to make sure that our junior colleagues realize that ideas are welcome , that initiative goes right down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top . 
I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources of ideas . 
The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function , regardless of rank . 
Further , I would hope that we could pay attention to little things . 
While observing the operations of our Government in various parts of the world , I have felt that in many situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor problems which spoiled our main effort . 
To cite only a few examples : The wrong man in the wrong position , perhaps even in a junior position abroad , can be a source of great harm to our policy ; ; 
the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City , or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstances in our Capital , can easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for . 
Dozens of seemingly small matters go wrong all over the world . 
Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them . 
I would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can do something about them . 
If the Department of State is to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington , it follows that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas . 
This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion . 
He is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed in his country . 
He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way he can . 
If any official operation abroad begins to go wrong , we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestions for remedial action . 
The problems of a policy officer 
It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts which I expressed privately in recent years , in the hope of clearing up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain compassion for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government . 
I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems that a senior departmental policy officer faces . 
This means practically everybody in this room . 
Whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine . 
The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli : an idea in his own head , the suggestions of a colleague , a question from the Secretary or the President , a proposal by another department , a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad , the filing of an item for the agenda of the United Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies , a news item read at the breakfast table , a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference , a speech by a Senator or Congressman , an article in a periodical , a resolution from a national organization , a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad , et cetera , ad infinitum . 
The policy officer lives with his antennae alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility . 
His first thought is about the question itself : Is there a question here for American foreign policy , and , if so , what is it ? ? 
For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job is to know what the question is -- that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer . 
Chewing it over with his colleagues and in his own mind , he reaches a tentative identification of the question -- tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered . 
Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts surrounding the problem , facts which he knows can never be complete , and the general background , much of which has already been lost to history . 
He is appreciative of the expert help available to him and draws these resources into play , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently policy-oriented conclusions . 
He knows that he must give the expert his place , but he knows that he must also keep him in it . 
He is already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action , including doing nothing . 
He knows that he is thinking about action in relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog . 
But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy , well-established precedents , the commitments of the United States under international charters and treaties , basic statutes , and well-understood notions of the American people about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy literature such as country papers and National Security Council papers accumulated in the Department . 
He will not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting results in the factual situation with which he is confronted . 
He must think about which of these principles must take precedence . 
He will know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his problem because of crucial changes in circumstance . 
He is aware that every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other problem . 
He must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to grasp . 
He must think of others who have a stake in the question and in its answer . 
Who should be consulted among his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies of the Government ? ? 
Which American ambassadors could provide helpful advice ? ? 
Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted ? ? 
What is the probable attitude of other governments , including those less directly involved ? ? 
How and at what stage and in what sequence are other governments to be consulted ? ? 
If action is indicated , what kind of action is relevant to the problem ? ? 
The selection of the wrong tools can mean waste , at best , and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself . 
Can the President or the Secretary act under existing authority , or will new legislation and new money be required ? ? 
Should the action be unilateral or multilateral ? ? 
Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international body ? ? 
For , if so , the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem . 
Respect for the opinions of mankind 
What type of action can hope to win public support , first in this country and then abroad ? ? 
For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned by the readiness of the country to sustain it . 
He is interested in public opinion for two reasons : first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public cares about a decent respect for the opinions of mankind . 
And , given probable public attitudes -- about which reasonably good estimates can be made -- what action is called for to insure necessary support ? ? 
May I add a caution on this particular point ? ? 
We do not want policy officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign policy action . 
In the first place our business is foreign policy , and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of a problem . 
Mr. Truman emphasized this point by saying , `` You fellows in the Department of State don't know much about domestic politics '' . 
This is an important consideration . 
If we sit here reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports that cross our desks , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion expressed in the absence of leadership . 
What the American people will do turns in large degree on their leadership . 
We cannot test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them for support for the necessary action . 
I doubt , for example , that , 3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan , any public-opinion expert would have said that the country would have accepted such proposals . 
The problem in the policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly complicated factors -- political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative -- to be sorted out and handled within a political system which moves by consent in relation to an external environment which cannot be under control . 
And the policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels . 
While there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex , there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and some open only to men or to women . 
The Peace Corps should not pay the expenses of a wife or family , unless the wife is also accepted for full-time Peace Corps work on the same project . 
There should be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service . 
In most cases service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary deferment . 
Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United States . 
Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid . 
The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual services . 
Rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance . 
Peace Corps volunteers should be given just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living . 
They should live in modest circumstances , avoiding all conspicuous consumption . 
Wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts . 
Some special health requirements might have to be met . 
For example , it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to pay medical expenses of volunteers . 
Perhaps existing Public Health Service , State Department and Armed Services medical facilities can be utilized . 
For readjustment to the U.S. , volunteers should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas service , based on the length of time served . 
7 . 
In what part of the government should the Peace Corps be established ? ? 
The idea of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people . 
Support for it cuts across party , regional , ethnic and other lines . 
The Peace Corps , therefore , offers an opportunity to add a new dimension to our approach to the world -- an opportunity for the American people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world development . 
For this , the Peace Corps should be administered by a small , new , alive agency operating as one component in our whole overseas operation . 
Pending the reorganization of our foreign aid structure and program , the Peace Corps should be established as an agency in the Department of State . 
When the aid operations are reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous , functional unit . 
Meanwhile , the Peace Corps could be physically located in ICA's facilities and depend on the State Department and ICA for administrative support and , when needed , program assistance . 
In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas operations . 
8 . 
How and when should the Peace Corps be launched ? ? 
The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear , with only preparatory work undertaken between now and when Congress finally appropriates special funds for it -- or it can be launched now and in earnest by executive action , with sufficient funds and made available from existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a number of substantial projects to start this summer . 
The Peace Corps should be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost . 
Nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university campuses . 
If launched in a careful but determined way within the next few weeks , the Peace Corps could have several hundred persons in training this summer for placement next fall . 
Within a year or two several thousand might be in service . 
It can then grow steadily as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated . 
9 . 
What would the first projects be ? ? 
In the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects . 
The need here is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified volunteers in a short period of time is greatest . 
There would , however , be a variety of other skills -- medical , agricultural , engineering -- which would be called for in the first year through the private agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers to existing development projects . 
The first year's projects should also be spread through several countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia . 
10 . 
How will the Peace Corps be received abroad ? ? 
Although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every newly developing nation , the readiness to receive such manpower , or to receive it from the United States will vary from country to country . 
A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected in many quarters . 
Unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything in their power to promote active hostility . 
But there are indications that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers , and that if the volunteers are well chosen , they will soon demonstrate their value and make many friends . 
It is important , however , that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War but as a contribution to the world community . 
In presenting it to other governments and to the United Nations , we could propose that every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating committee . 
We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands . 
In any case , our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as technician helpers in development projects of the U.N. and other international agencies . 
The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership . 
Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach . 
The Peace Corps offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country needs for trained manpower . 
If presented in this spirit , the response and the results will be immeasurably better . 
11 . 
How will it be financed ? ? 
The already appropriated funds within the discretion of the President and Secretary of State under the Mutual Security Act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's pilot programs of the Peace Corps . 
If it is decided to make a small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance funds , in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual Security Act through this new peaceful program , this will be a hopeful sign to the world . 
Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year . 
Specifically , Congress should consider authorizing the Peace Corps to receive contributions from American businesses , unions , civic organizations and the public at large . 
For this must be the project of the whole American people . 
An Advisory Council of outstanding public figures with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding . 
Steps should also be taken to link the Food for Peace Program with the Peace Corps , so that foreign currencies accumulated by the sale of U.S. surplus food under P.L. 480 can be put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps personnel . 
The extent to which participating bodies such as U. S. voluntary agencies , universities , international organizations , and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored . 
12 . 
Is it worth the cost and the risks ? ? 
No matter how well conceived and efficiently run , there probably will be failures . 
These could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad . 
But as the popular response suggests , the potentiality of the Peace Corps is very great . 
It can contribute to the development of critical countries and regions . 
It can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country . 
It can also contribute to the education of America and to more intelligent American participation in the world . 
With thousands of young Americans going to work in developing areas , millions of Americans will become more directly involved in the world than ever before . 
With colleges and universities carrying a large part of the program , and with students looking toward Peace Corps service , there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness . 
The letters home , the talks later given by returning members of the Peace Corps , the influence on the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad -- all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible American policies toward the world . 
And this is meeting the world's need , too , since what the world most needs from this country is better understanding of the world . 
The Peace Corps thus can add a new dimension to America's world policy -- one for which people here and abroad have long been waiting . 
As you said in your State of the Union message , `` The problems are towering and unprecedented -- and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well '' . 
To the Congress of the United States : 
I recommend to the Congress the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps -- a pool of trained American men and women sent overseas by the U.S. Government or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower . 
I have today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on a temporary pilot basis . 
The temporary Peace Corps will be a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more effective plans for a permanent organization . 
In addition , by starting the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them in overseas positions by late fall . 
This temporary Peace Corps is being established under existing authority in the Mutual Security Act and will be located in the Department of State . 
Its initial expenses will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign aid program . 
Throughout the world the people of the newly developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which reflects their deepest desires . 
Our own freedom , and the future of freedom around the world , depend , in a very real sense , on their ability to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity , liberated from the bonds of hunger , ignorance and poverty . 
One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics , and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages , the mountains , the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations . 
The vast task of economic development urgently requires skilled people to do the work of the society -- to help teach in the schools , construct development projects , demonstrate modern methods of sanitation in the villages , and perform a hundred other tasks calling for training and advanced knowledge . 
To meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace Corps -- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers , sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations . 
This organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work . 
They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments , acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice . 
There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them . 
Wildlife habitat resources 
In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for the primary purpose of hunting and fishing . 
Hunter and fisherman visits since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale of hunting and fishing licenses . 
This use is expected to increase to about 50 million visits by 1972 . 
The long-range objective of habitat management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment . 
The wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period are : 1 . 
Revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plans for all administrative units , assuring proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resources . 
2 . 
Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National Forests and Grasslands are located , as a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs , including ( A ) big-game , gamebird , and small-game habitat surveys and investigations on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands , ( B ) fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes and impoundments , and ( C ) participation in planning , inspection , and control phases of all habitat improvement , land and water use projects conducted on National Forest lands by States , other Federal agencies , and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource values . 
3 . 
Improve food and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas . 
4 . 
Develop wildlife openings , food patches , and game ways in dense vegetation by clearing or controlled burning on 400,000 acres . 
5 . 
Improve 7,000 miles of fishing streams and 56,000 acres of lakes by stabilizing banks , planting streamside cover , and constructing channel improvements . 
Protection 
The total adverse impact of disease , insects , fire , weather , destructive animals , and other forces on the uses and values of forest resources is not generally recognized . 
They kill and destroy , retard or prevent reproduction and growth , impair and damage values , and disrupt uses . 
The loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet . 
If it were not for the effect of destructive agencies , sawtimber growth would have been nearly twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952 . 
About 45 percent of the loss in growth was attributable to disease , 20 percent to insects , 17 percent to fire , and 18 percent to weather , animals , and various other causes . 
These destructive forces also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows , and upon the other renewable forest resources . 
The long-range objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and high-level sustained yield of products and services . 
This can be accomplished substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical fire periods , and a more intensive application of a program of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations . 
In addition to direct protection measures , more intensive management of timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and disease . 
Protection from insects and disease 
In the 10-year period , it is proposed that insect and disease control on the National Forest System be stepped up to a level of prevention , detection , and control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial period . 
This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection . 
The work will consist of : 1 . 
Intensification of present activities through ( A ) quicker , more extensive , and more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks ; ; 
( B ) more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread damage ; ; 
( C ) quicker and more effective control action in the initial stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic . 
The initial suppression activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated . 
2 . 
Continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should be managed for white pine production . 
The objective is to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be needed . 
3 . 
Initiating a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites . 
4 . 
Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities to reduce losses . 
Protection from fire 
It is proposed that in 10 years all commercial timberlands , all critical watersheds , and other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads . 
This will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving such protection . 
An additional 15 million acres will be given a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation . 
Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for : 1 . 
Expansion , modernization , and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted standards . 
This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present level of preventive effort , detection , skilled fire-fighting crews , and equipment use . 
This will include a stepped-up program of training and development of personnel . 
2 . 
Adoption and use of new and modern techniques being developed for prevention , for suppression of fires while small , and for stopping large fires while running and burning intensely . 
3 . 
Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value areas . 
This work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land needing such treatment , and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly hazardous debris concentration , felling snags on 350,000 acres of high lightning-occurrence areas , prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres , removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres , and clearing and maintaining 11,000 miles of firebreaks . 
Protection from other damage 
Rodent control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of the most serious infestations of harmful rodents , such as porcupines and mice , on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands . 
These areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the National Forests . 
Approximately 1.8 million acres of rangelands and 9.4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period . 
Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means of control are known . 
Roads and trails 
The transportation system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions . 
This system is divided into a forest highway system , administered by the Secretary of Commerce , and a forest development road and trail system , administered by the Secretary of Agriculture . 
Both of these systems are essential for the production , development , and use of the National Forests . 
In the forest highway system , there are now 24,400 miles of public roads . 
These are mostly through highways that carry traffic going from one destination to another . 
Because administration of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties , this Development Program for the National Forests does not include estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the additions to it that are needed . 
It is estimated that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed to fully serve the National Forests . 
In the forest development road and trail system , there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 106,500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails . 
These roads are largely of less than highway standards , and usually carry traffic which is related to use of the National Forests . 
Construction and maintenance of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture . 
It is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development roads , and 80,000 miles of trails , constitute the system that will eventually be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood , water , forage , and wildlife and recreation resources of the National Forests on a continuing basis . 
The ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection . 
It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum service to these important resources and watersheds . 
The presence or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as : ( A ) 
the protection of forage , timber , and wildlife resources from fire , insects , and disease ; ; 
( B ) 
the balanced use of recreation , hunting , and fishing areas ; ; 
( C ) 
the volume of timber that can be marketed , especially for small sales and the support of dependent communities and small business enterprises ; ; 
( D ) 
the level of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire , windstorm , insects , and disease ; ; 
( E ) 
the protection of watershed lands from erosion and overgrazing by animals . 
The existence of road systems permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes that is not otherwise possible . 
Furthermore , roads that give access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own way over a period of years . 
Use of these roads by the public results in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve . 
The long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected needs and optimum production of products and services . 
For the year 2000 this means servicing ( A ) the protection requirements of a watershed producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year , ( B ) recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors , ( C ) a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board feet , and ( D ) 60 million acres of rangelands . 
Service at these levels of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new trails , along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails . 
About 26,500 miles of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of new roads . 
About 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be met by the year 2000 . 
Program proposals for forest development roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows : 1 . 
Complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79,400 miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000 miles of trails . 
This constitutes about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities . 
Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed by purchasers of National Forest timber , but paid for by the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices . 
2 . 
Provide maintenance to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during the period . 
Land adjustment , land purchase , land use 
Within the units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership is quite irregular . 
In some units , National Forest ownership is well blocked together . 
In many others , the previous patenting of land under the public land laws , or the way in which land was available for purchase , resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership . 
Within exterior boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands , there are about 40,000,000 acres in non-Federal ownership . 
One consequence is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring National Forest or other Federal land , or because such ownerships are developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public of neighboring National Forest land . 
Some privately held inholdings are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands . 
And some , which are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes , are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation , and are contributing nothing to the economy ; ; 
there are no reasonable prospects that these conditions will be corrected or changed . 
Lands in this last category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the Eastern States . 
The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development , or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests and National Grasslands . 
Strategy and tactics of the U.S. military forces are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history . 
The change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made with care , mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected in favor of the other . 
Our military forces must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war . 
Forces and military personnel strength . 
-- This budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately the present level -- a year-end strength of 2,489,000 men and women in the active forces . 
The forces to be supported include an Army of 14 divisions and 870,000 men ; ; 
a Navy of 817 active ships and 619,000 men ; ; 
a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175,000 men ; ; 
and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825,000 men . 
If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war , their basic organization and objectives must conform to the changing character and missions of the active forces . 
Quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere numbers . 
Under modern conditions , this is especially true of the ready reserve . 
I have requested the Secretary of Defense to reexamine the roles and missions of the reserve components in relation to those of the active forces and in the light of the changing requirements of modern warfare . 
Last year the Congress discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel strength limitations on the Army Reserve . 
Similar restrictions on the strength of the Army National Guard contained in the 1960 Department of Defense Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped . 
I strongly recommend to the Congress the avoidance of mandatory floors on the size of the reserve components so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustments in keeping with military necessity . 
I again proposed a reduction in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve -- from their present strengths of 400,000 and 300,000 , respectively , to 360,000 and 270,000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961 . 
These strengths are considered adequate to meet the essential roles and missions of the reserves in support of our national security objectives . 
Military personnel costs . 
-- About 30% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense in 1961 are for military personnel costs , including pay for active , reserve , and retired military personnel . 
These expenditures are estimated to be $12.1 billion , an increase of $187 million over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity pay of career personnel , more dependents , an increased number of men drawing proficiency pay , and social security tax increases ( effective for the full year in 1961 compared with only 6 months in 1960 ) . 
Retired pay costs are increased by $94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retired personnel . 
These increased costs are partially offset by a decrease of $56 million in expenditures for the reserve forces , largely because of the planned reduction in strength of the Army Reserve components during 1961 . 
Traditionally , rates of pay for retired military personnel have been proportionate to current rates of pay for active personnel . 
The 1958 military pay act departed from this established formula by providing for a 6% increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retired prior to its effective date of June 1 , 1958 . 
I endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retired and active duty pay rates . 
Operation and maintenance . 
-- Expenditures for operating and maintaining the stations and equipment of the Armed Forces are estimated to be $10.3 billion in 1961 , which is $184 million more than in 1960 . 
The increase stems largely from the growing complexity of and higher degree of maintenance required for newer weapons and equipment . 
A substantial increase is estimated in the cost of operating additional communications systems in the air defense program , as well as in all programs where speed and security of communications are essential . 
Also , the program for fleet modernization will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase in expenditures . 
Further increases arise from the civilian employee health program enacted by the Congress last year . 
Other factors increasing operating costs include the higher unit cost of each flying hour , up 11% in two years , and of each steaming hour , up 15% . 
In total , these increases in operating costs outweigh the savings that result from declining programs and from economy measures , such as reduced numbers of units and installations , smaller inventories of major equipment , and improvements in the supply and distribution systems of the Armed Forces . 
In the budget message for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal of section 601 of the Act of September 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) . 
This section prevents the military departments and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization from carrying out certain transactions involving real property unless they come into agreement with the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives . 
As I have stated previously , the Attorney General has advised me that this section violates fundamental constitutional principles . 
Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress at its present session , I shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the Secretary of Defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise . 
Basic long-line communications in Alaska are now provided through Federal facilities operated by the Army , Air Force , and Federal Aviation Agency . 
The growing communications needs of this new State can best be met , as they have in other States , through the operation and development of such facilities by private enterprise . 
Legislation has already been proposed to authorize the sale of these Government-owned systems in Alaska , and its early enactment is desirable . 
Procurement , research , and construction . 
-- Approximately 45% of the expenditures for the Department of Defense are for procurement , research , development , and construction programs . 
In 1961 , these expenditures are estimated at $18.9 billion , compared to $19.3 billion in 1960 . 
The decreases , which are largely in construction and in aircraft procurement , are offset in part by increases for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such as tanks , vehicles , guns , and electronic devices . 
Expenditures for shipbuilding are estimated at about the same level as in 1960 . 
New obligational authority for 1961 recommended in this budget for aircraft procurement ( excluding amounts for related research and construction ) totals $4,753 million , which is $1,390 million below that enacted for 1960 . 
On the other hand , the new authority of $3,825 million proposed for missile procurement ( excluding research and construction ) in 1961 is $581 million higher than for 1960 . 
These contrasting trends in procurement reflect the anticipated changes in the composition and missions of our Armed Forces in the years ahead . 
The Department of Defense appropriation acts for the past several years have contained a rider which limits competitive bidding by firms in other countries on certain military supply items . 
As I have repeatedly stated , this provision is much more restrictive than the general law , popularly known as the Buy American Act . 
I urge once again that the Congress not reenact this rider . 
The task of providing a reasonable level of military strength , without endangering other vital aspects of our security , is greatly complicated by the swift pace of scientific progress . 
The last few years have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances in military technology in history . 
Some weapons systems have become obsolescent while still in production , and some while still under development . 
Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon system , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance of other competitive systems . 
This has necessitated a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resources to the newer and more important weapons systems and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapons systems which have been overtaken by events . 
Thus , in the last few years , a number of programs which looked very promising at the time their development was commenced have since been completely eliminated . 
For example , the importance of the Regulus 2 , a very promising aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile launched by submerged submarines . 
Another example is the recent cancellation of the F-108 , a long-range interceptor with a speed three times as great as the speed of sound , which was designed for use against manned bombers in the period of the mid-1960's . 
The substantial progress being made in ballistic missile technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles . 
Considering the high cost of the F-108 system -- over $4 billion for the force that had been planned -- and the time period in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work on the project . 
Meanwhile , other air defense forces are being made effective , as described later in this message . 
The size and scope of other important programs have been reduced from earlier plans . 
Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range ballistic missiles , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile . 
The impact of technological factors is also illustrated by the history of the high-energy fuel program . 
This project was started at a time when there was a critical need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft , particularly our heavy bombers . 
Continuing technical problems involved in the use of this fuel , coupled with significant improvements in aircraft range through other means , have now raised serious questions about the value of the high-energy fuel program . 
As a result , the scope of this project has been sharply curtailed . 
These examples underscore the importance of even more searching evaluations of new major development programs and even more penetrating and far-ranging analyses of the potentialities of future technology . 
The cost of developing a major weapon system is now so enormous that the greatest care must be exercised in selecting new systems for development , in determining the most satisfactory rate of development , and in deciding the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it . 
Strategic forces . 
-- The deterrent power of our Armed Forces comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability and their capability to conduct other essential operations in any form of war . 
The first capability is represented by a combination of manned bombers , carrier-based aircraft , and intercontinental and intermediate range missiles . 
The second capability is represented by our deployed ground , naval , and air forces in essential forward areas , together with ready reserves capable of effecting early emergency reinforcement . 
The Strategic Air Command is the principal element of our long-range nuclear capability . 
One of the important and difficult decisions which had to be made in this budget concerned the role of the B-70 , a long-range supersonic bomber . 
This aircraft , which was planned for initial operational use about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile systems , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier . 
The first Atlas ICBM's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines are expected to be operational this calendar year , and the first Titan ICBM's next year . 
The Minuteman solid-fueled ICBM is planned to be operational about mid-1963 . 
By 1965 , several or all of these systems will have been fully tested and their reliability established . 
Thus , the need for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system is doubtful . 
However , I am recommending that development work on the B-70 air-frame and engines be continued . 
It is expected that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight testing . 
By that time we should be in a much better position to determine the value of that aircraft as a weapon system . 
I am recommending additional acquisitions of the improved version of the B-52 ( the B-52H with the new turbofan engine ) and procurement of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber , together with the supporting refueling tankers in each case . 
These additional modern bombers will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers ; ; 
one B-52 can do the work of several B-47's which it will replace . 
Funds are also included in this budget to continue the equipping of the B-52 wings with the Hound Dog air-to-surface missile . 
In the coming fiscal year additional quantities of Atlas , Titan , and Polaris missiles also will be procured . 
Purchase authorizations will include provisions relating to the sale and delivery of commodities , including the classes , types and/or varieties of food grain , the time and circumstances of deposit of the rupees accruing from such sale , and other relevant matters . 
3 . 
The United States recognizes the desire of India to accumulate , as quickly as possible , a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice provided for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal markets for this commodity in India . 
Under this Agreement the first annual review of rice availabilities will be made in August 1960 . 
At that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of the United States supplies of rice available for Title 1 , disposal , India's production , consumption and stocks of food grains , other imports from the United States and countries friendly to the United States , India's storage capacity , and other related factors , any increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed which is currently planned for procurement during the first year . 
4 . 
The two Governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations for wheat and rice providing for purchase after June 30 , 1961 , shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available under Title 1 , of the Act at that time . 
The United States Government shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales under this Agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time after June 30 , 1961 , that such action is necessitated by the existence of an international emergency . 
Article 2 , uses of rupees 
1 . 
The two Governments agree that the rupees accruing to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this Agreement will be used by the Government of the United States of America , in such manner and order of priority as the Government of the United States of America shall determine , for the following purposes in the amounts shown : ( A ) 
For United States expenditures under subsections ( A ) , ( B ) , ( D ) , ( E ) , ( F ) , ( H ) through ( R ) of Section 104 of the Act or under any of such subsections , the rupee equivalent of $200 million . 
( B )

2 . 
In the event the total of rupees accruing to the Government of the United States of America as a consequence of sales made pursuant to this Agreement is different from the rupee equivalent of $1,276 million , the amounts available for the purposes specified in paragraph 1 , Article 2 , will be adjusted proportionately . 
Article 3 , deposit of rupees 
The deposit of rupees to the account of the Government of the United States of America in payment for the commodities and for ocean transportation costs financed by the Government of the United States of America ( except excess costs resulting from the requirement that United States flag vessels be used ) shall be made at the rate of exchange for United States dollars generally applicable to import transactions ( excluding imports granted a preferential rate ) in effect on the dates of dollar disbursement by United States banks , or by the Government of the United States of America , as provided in the purchase authorizations . 
Article 4 , general undertakings 
1 . 
The Government of India agrees that it will take all possible measures to prevent the resale or transshipment to other countries or the use for other than domestic purposes ( except where such resale , transshipment or use is specifically approved by the Government of the United States of America ) , of the surplus agricultural commodities purchased pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement , and to assure that the purchase of such commodities does not result in increased availability of these or like commodities for export from India . 
2 . 
The two Governments agree that they will take reasonable precautions to assure that all sales or purchases of surplus agricultural commodities , pursuant to the Agreement will not displace usual marketings of the United States of America in these commodities , or unduly disrupt world prices of agricultural commodities or normal patterns of commercial trade with friendly countries .

In witness whereof , the respective representatives , duly authorized for the purpose , have signed the present Agreement . 
Done at Washington in duplicate this fourth day of May 1960 . 
For the government of the United States of America : 
Dwight D. Eisenhower 
for the government of India : 
S. K. Patil Excellency : 
I have the honor to refer to the Agricultural Commodities Agreement signed today between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of India ( hereinafter referred to as the Agreement ) and , with regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2 , of the Agreement , to state that the understanding of the Government of the United States of America is as follows : 1 . 
With respect to Article 2 , , Paragraph 1 ( A ) of the Agreement : ( 1 ) 
The Government of India will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent of $4 million ( up to a maximum of $1 million per year ) accruing under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes into currencies other than United States dollars on request of the Government of the United States of America . 
This facility is needed for the purpose of securing funds to finance agricultural market development activities of the Government of the United States in other countries . 
The Government of the United States of America may utilize rupees in India to pay for goods and services , including international transportation needed in connection with market development and other agricultural projects and activities in India and other countries . 
( 2 ) 
The rupee equivalent of $63.8 million , but not more than 5 percent of the currencies received under the Agreement will be used for loans to be made by the Export-Import Bank of Washington under Section 104 ( E ) of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act , as amended ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) , and for administrative expenses of the Export-Import Bank of Washington in India incident thereto . 
It is understood that : ( A ) 
Such loans under Section 104 ( E ) of the Act will be made to United States business firms and branches , subsidiaries , or affiliates of such firms in India for business development and trade expansion in India and to United States firms and to Indian firms for the establishment of facilities for aiding in the utilization , distribution , or otherwise increasing the consumption of and markets for United States agricultural products . 
In the event the rupees set aside for loans under Section 104 ( E ) of the Act are not advanced within six years from the date of this Agreement because the Export-Import Bank of Washington has not approved loans or because proposed loans have not been mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank of Washington and the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government of India , the Government of the United States of America may use the rupees for any purpose authorized by Section 104 of the Act . 
( B ) 
Loans will be mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank of Washington and the Government of India acting through the Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance . 
The Secretary , Department of Economic Affairs , or his designate , will act for the Government of India , and the President of the Export-Import Bank of Washington , or his designate , will act for the Export-Import Bank of Washington . 
( C ) 
Upon receipt of an application which the Export-Import Bank is prepared to consider , the Export-Import Bank will inform the Department of Economic Affairs of the identity of the applicant , the nature of the proposed business , the amount of the proposed loan , and the general purposes for which the loan proceeds would be expended . 
( D ) 
When the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application , it will so notify the Department of Economic Affairs and will indicate the interest rate and the repayment period which would be used under the proposed loan . 
The interest rate will be similar to those prevailing in India on comparable loans and the maturities will be consistent with the purposes of the financing . 
( E ) 
Within sixty days after the receipt of notice that the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application the Department of Economic Affairs will indicate to the Export-Import Bank whether or not the Department of Economic Affairs has any objection to the proposed loan . 
Unless within the sixty-day period the Export-Import Bank has received such a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs it shall be understood that the Department of Economic Affairs has no objection to the proposed loan . 
When the Export-Import Bank approves or declines the proposed loan , it will notify the Department of Economic Affairs . 
2 . 
With respect to Article 2 , , paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) : Uses of Section 104 ( E ) and Section 104 ( G ) rupees : The Government of India will use the amount of rupees granted or loaned to it by the United States pursuant to paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) for projects to promote economic development with emphasis upon the agricultural sector including food reserve storage structures and facilities as may from time to time be agreed upon by the authorized representatives of the United States and the authorized representatives of the Government of India , in the following sectors : A . 
Agriculture ; ; 
B . 
Industry , including the production of fertilizer , irrigation and power , transport and communications , and credit institutions ; ; 
C . 
Public health , education , and rehabilitation ; ; 
D . 
Other economic development projects consistent with the purposes of Sections 104 ( E ) and 104 ( G ) of the Act . 
The Government of India further agrees in cooperation with the Government of the United States , to coordinate the use of grant and loan funds provided for in paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , with such direct dollar assistance as may be made available by the Government of the United States of America , so that both sources of financing may be channeled to specific and clearly identifiable economic development programs and projects . 
3 . 
It is agreed that any goods delivered or services rendered after the date of this agreement for projects within categories A , B , and C under paragraph 2 above which may later be approved by the United States will be eligible for financing from currency granted or loaned to the Government of India . 
4 . 
With regard to the rupees accruing to uses indicated under Article 2 , of the Agreement , the understanding of the Government of the United States of America , with respect to both paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , is as follows : ( 1 ) 
Local currency will be advanced or reimbursed to the Government of India for financing agreed projects under paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , of the Agreement upon the presentation of such documentation as the United States may specify . 
( 2 ) 
The Government of India shall maintain or cause to be maintained books and records adequate to identify the goods and services financed for agreed projects pursuant to paragraphs 1 ( B ) and 1 ( C ) of Article 2 , of the Agreement , to disclose the use thereof in the projects and to record the progress of the projects ( including the cost thereof ) . 
The books and records with respect to each project shall be maintained for the duration of the project , or until the expiration of three years after final disbursement for the project has been made by the United States , whichever is later . 
The two Governments shall have the right at all reasonable times to examine such books and records and all other documents , correspondence , memoranda and other records involving transactions relating to agreed projects . 
The Government of India shall enable the authorized representatives of the United States to observe and review agreed projects and the utilization of goods and services financed under the projects , and shall furnish to the United States all such information as it shall reasonably request concerning the above-mentioned matters and the expenditures related thereto . 
This broad delegation leaves within our discretion ( subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest ) both the determination of what degree of interference shall be considered excessive , and the methods by which such excessive interference shall be avoided . 
3 . 
The present proceeding is concerned with the standard broadcast ( AM ) band , from 540 kc. to 1600 kc. . 
Whenever two or more standard broadcast stations operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequencies , each interferes to some extent with reception of the other . 
The extent of such interference -- which may be so slight as to be undetectable at any point where either of the stations renders a usable signal , or may be so great as to virtually destroy the service areas of both stations -- depends on many factors , among the principal ones being the distance between the stations , their respective radiated power , and , of particular significance here , the time of day . 
Other factors playing a part in the extent of AM service and interference are the frequency involved , the time of year , the position of the year in the sunspot cycle , ground conductivity along the transmission path , atmospheric and manmade noise , and others . 
With the existence of these many factors , some of them variable , it obviously has never been and is not now possible for the Commission to make assignments of AM stations on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstances . 
Rather , such assignments are made , as they must be , on the basis of certain overall rules and standards , representing to some extent a statistical approach to the problem , taking into account for each situation some of the variables ( e.g. , power and station separations ) and averaging out others in order to achieve the balance which must be struck between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of stations large enough to afford optimum radio service to the Nation . 
An example of the overall standards applied is the 20-to-1 ratio established for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which is regarded as objectionable . 
By this standard , it is determined that where two stations operating on the same frequency are involved , objectionable interference from station A exists at any point within the service area of station B where station A's signal is of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station B's signal at that point . 
4 . 
The 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embodies one of the fundamental limiting principles which we must always take into account in AM assignments and allocations -- that signals from a particular station are potential sources of objectionable interference over an area much greater than that within which they provide useful service . 
A second fundamental principle is that involved particularly in the present proceeding -- the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation conditions with respect to the standard broadcast frequencies . 
This is a phenomenon familiar to all radio listeners , resulting from reflection of skywave signals at night from the ionized layer in the upper atmosphere known as the ionosphere . 
All AM stations radiate both skywave and groundwave signals , at all hours ; ; 
but during the middle daytime hours these skywave radiations are not reflected in any substantial quantity , and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference are , in general , negligible . 
But during nighttime hours the skywave radiations are reflected from the ionosphere , thereby creating the possibility of one station's rendering service , via skywave , at a much greater distance than it can through its groundwave signal , and at the same time vastly complicating the interference problem because of the still greater distance over which these skywave signals may cause interference to the signals of stations on the same and closely adjacent frequencies . 
Because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation conditions , it has been necessary to evolve different allocation structures for daytime and nighttime broadcasting in the AM band , with many more stations operating during the day than at night . 
5 . 
It was recognized years ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation conditions , and vice versa , is not an instantaneous process , but takes place over periods of time from roughly 2 hours before sunset until about 2 hours after sunset , and again from roughly 2 hours before sunrise until some 2 hours after sunrise . 
During the period of about 4 hours around sunset , skywave transmission conditions are building up until full nighttime conditions prevail ; ; 
during the same period around sunrise , skywave transmission is declining , until at about 2 hours after sunrise it reaches a point where it becomes of little practical significance . 
However , in this case as elsewhere it was necessary to arrive at a single standard to be applied to all situations , representing an averaging of conditions , and thus to fix particular points in time which would be considered the dividing points between daytime and nighttime conditions . 
It was determined that the hours of sunrise and sunset , respectively , should be used for this purpose . 
Accordingly , the 1938-39 rules adopted these hours as limitations upon the operation of daytime stations . 
Class 2 , stations operating on clear channels are required to cease operation or operate under nighttime restrictions beginning either at local sunset ( for daytime class 2 , stations ) or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 , station where located west of the class 2 , station ( for limited-time class 2 , stations ) . 
The same restrictions apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 , stations operating on regional channels , which after that time are required to operate under nighttime restrictions in order to protect each other . 
With respect to nighttime assignments , the degree of skywave service and interference is determined by skywave curves ( figs. 1 and 2 of sec. 3.190 of the rules ) giving average skywave values . 
These curves were derived by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data . 
It was recognized that skywave signals , because of their reflected nature , are of great variability and subject to wide fluctuations in strength . 
For this reason , the more uncertain skywave service was denominated `` secondary '' in our rules , as compared to the steadier , more reliable groundwave `` primary service '' , and , for both skywave service and skywave interference , signal strength is expressed in terms of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level is exceeded -- 50 percent of the time for skywave service , 10 percent of the time for skywave interference . 
Allocation policies 
6 . 
As mentioned , the allocation of AM stations represents a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of stations . 
The rules and policies to be applied in this process of course must be based on objectives which represent what is to be desired if radio service is to be of maximum use to the Nation . 
Our objectives , as we have stated many times , are -- ( 1 ) 
To provide some service to all listeners ; ; 
( 2 ) 
To provide as many choices of service to as many listeners as possible ; ; 
( 3 ) 
To provide service of local origin to as many listeners as possible . 
Since broadcast frequencies are very limited in number , these objectives are to some extent inconsistent in that not all of them can be fully realized , and to the extent that each is realized , there is a corresponding reduction of the possibilities for fullest achievement of the others . 
Accordingly , the Commission has recognized that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency does not necessarily represent the best pattern for other frequencies , and has assigned different frequencies for use by different classes of stations . 
Some 45 frequencies are assigned for use primarily by dominant Class 1 , -- A or Class 1 , -- B clear-channel stations , designed to operate with adequate power and to provide service -- both groundwave and ( at night ) skywave -- over large areas and at great distances , being protected against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective . 
In dealing with these frequencies , the objective listed first above -- provision of service to all listeners -- was predominant ; ; 
the other objectives were subordinated to it . 
The class 1 , stations on these clear channels are protected to their 0.1-mv./m. groundwave contours against daytime cochannel interference . 
With respect to skywave service rendered at night , class 1 , -- A stations are the only stations permitted to operate in the United States on clear channels specified for class 1 , -- A operation , and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be received ; ; 
class 1 , -- B stations are protected at night to their 0.5-mv./m. 50-percent time skywave contours against cochannel interference . 
Since the provision of skywave service requires adequate freedom from interference , only class 1 , stations are capable of rendering skywave service . 
But nighttime operation by stations of other classes of course entails skywave interference to groundwave service , interference which is substantial unless steps are taken to minimize it . 
7 . 
With respect to other frequencies , these are designated as regional or local , and assigned for use by class 3 , and class 4 , stations , respectively , stations operating generally with lower power . 
In the allocation pattern worked out for these frequencies , the provision of long-range service has to some extent been subordinated to the other two objectives -- assignment of multiple facilities , and assignment of stations in as many communities as possible . 
8 . 
As mentioned , the primary allocation objective to be followed in the allocation of stations on clear channels is the provision of widespread service , free from destructive interference . 
During nighttime hours , because of the intense skywave propagation then prevailing , no large number of stations can be permitted to operate on one of these channels , if the wide area service for which these frequencies are assigned is to be rendered satisfactorily by the dominant stations which must be relied upon to render it . 
Therefore , under our longstanding allocation rules , on some of these channels no station other than the dominant ( class 1 ) -- A ) station is permitted to operate at night , so that the 1 , -- A station can render service , interference free , wherever it can be received . 
On the remainder of the clear channels , the dominant ( class 1 ) -- B stations are protected as described above , and the relatively small number of secondary ( class 2 ) ) stations permitted to operate on these channels at night are required to operate directionally and/or with reduced power so as to protect the class 1 , stations . 
In the daytime , on the other hand , since skywave transmission is relatively inefficient , it is possible to assign a substantially larger number of stations on these channels . 
Additional class 2 , assignments for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference to the class 1 , stations or to each other , and by their operation provide additional service on these channels and additional local outlets for a large number of communities . 
Such additional daytime class 2 , assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made of these frequencies , and the Commission has over the years made a large number of them . 
Similarly , on the regional channels many class 3 , stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power . 
9 . 
Essentially , the question presented for decision in the present Daytime Skywave proceeding is whether our decision ( in 1938-1939 ) to assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset , is sound as a basis for AM allocations , or whether , in the light of later developments and new understanding , skywave transmission is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account , and some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these hours . 
The history of the proceeding 
10 . 
The decision reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof . 
Since then , there has been a notable increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new techniques for using it , leading to a better understanding of propagation phenomena . 
In 1947 , affidavits were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service areas of these stations during daylight hours , from class 2 , stations whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to create skywave intereference .

The same is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should have used the Standard Deduction or Tax Table . 
The words amended return should be plainly written across the top of such return . 
When and where to file 
April 15 is usually the final date for filing income tax returns for most people because they use the calendar year ending on December 31 . 
If you use a fiscal year , a year ending on the last day of any month other than December , your return is due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of your tax year . 
Saturday , Sunday , or holiday . 
If the last day ( due date ) for performing any act for tax purposes , such as filing a return or making a tax payment , etc. , falls on Saturday , Sunday , or a legal holiday , you may perform that act on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday , Sunday , or legal holiday . 
Since April 15 , 1962 , is on Sunday your return for the calendar year 1961 will be timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday , April 16 , 1962 . 
If you mail A return or tax payment , you must place it in the mails in ample time to reach the district director on or before the due date . 
Declaration of estimated tax . 
If you were required to file a declaration of estimated tax for the calendar year 1961 , it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 15 , 1962 , if you file your income tax return Form 1040 , and pay your tax in full for the calendar year 1961 by January 31 , 1962 . 
The filing of an original or amended declaration , otherwise due on January 15 , 1962 , is also waived , if you file your Form 1040 for 1961 and pay the full tax by January 31 , 1962 . 
Farmers , for these purposes , have until February 15 , 1962 , to file Form 1040 and pay the tax in full for the calendar year 1961 . 
Fiscal year taxpayers have until the last day of the first month following the close of the fiscal year ( farmers until the 15th day of the 2d month ) . 
See Chapter 38 . 
Nonresident aliens living in Canada or Mexico who earn wages in the United States may be subject to withholding of tax on their wages , the same as if they were citizens of the United States . 
Their United States tax returns are due April 16 , 1962 . 
However , if their United States income is not subject to the withholding of tax on wages , their returns are due June 15 , 1962 , if they use a calendar year , or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of their fiscal year . 
Nonresident aliens in Puerto Rico . 
If you are a nonresident alien and a resident of Puerto Rico , your return is also due June 15 , 1962 , or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of your fiscal year . 
If A taxpayer dies , the executor , administrator , or legal representative must file the final return for the decedent on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the deceased taxpayer's normal tax year . 
Suppose John Jones , who , for 1960 , filed on the basis of a calendar year , died June 20 , 1961 . 
His return for the period January 1 to June 20 , 1961 , is due April 16 , 1962 . 
The return for a decedent may also serve as a claim for refund of an overpayment of tax . 
In such a case , Form 1310 should be completed and attached to the return . 
This form may be obtained from the local office of your district director . 
Returns of estates or trusts are due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of the tax year . 
Extensions of time for filing . 
Under unusual circumstances a resident individual may be granted an extension of time to file a return . 
You may apply for such an extension by filing Form 2688 , Application For Extension Of Time To File , with the District Director of Internal Revenue for your district , or you may make your application in a letter . 
Your application must include the following information : ( 1 ) your reasons for requesting an extension , ( 2 ) whether you filed timely income tax returns for the 3 preceding years , and ( 3 ) whether you were required to file an estimated return for the year , and if so whether you did file and have paid the estimated tax payments on or before the due dates . 
Any failure to file timely returns or make estimated tax payments when due must be fully explained . 
Extensions are not granted as a matter of course , and the reasons for your request must be substantial . 
If you are unable to sign the request , because of illness or other good cause , another person who stands in close personal or business relationship to you may sign the request on your behalf , stating the reason why you are unable to sign . 
You should make any request for an extension early so that if it is refused , your return may still be on time . 
See also Interest On Unpaid Taxes , below . 
Extensions while abroad . 
Citizens of the United States who , on April 15 , are not in the United States or Puerto Rico , are allowed an extension of time until June 15 for filing the return for the preceding calendar year . 
An extension of 2 months beyond the regular due date for filing is also available to taxpayers making returns for a fiscal year . 
Alaska and Hawaii . 
Taxpayers residing or traveling in Alaska are also allowed this extension of time for filing , but those residing or traveling in Hawaii are not allowed this automatic extension . 
Military or Naval Personnel on duty in Alaska or outside the United States and Puerto Rico are also allowed this automatic extension of time for filing their returns . 
You must attach a statement to your return , if you take advantage of this automatic extension , showing that you were in Alaska or were outside the United States or Puerto Rico on April 15 or other due date . 
Interest on unpaid taxes . 
Interest at the rate of 6% a year must be paid on taxes that are not paid on or before their due date . 
Such interest must be paid even though an extension of time for filing is granted . 
When payment is due . 
If your computation on Form 1040 or Form 1040A shows you owe additional tax , it should be remitted with your return unless you owe less than $1 , in which case it is forgiven . 
If payment is by cash , you should ask for a receipt . 
If you file Form 1040A and the District Director computes your tax , you will be sent a bill if additional tax is due . 
This bill should be paid within 30 days . 
Payment by check or money order . 
Whether the check is certified or uncertified , the tax is not paid until the check is paid . 
If the check is not good and the April 15 or other due date deadline elapses , additions to the tax may be incurred . 
Furthermore , a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalties . 
All checks and money orders should be made payable to Internal Revenue Service . 
Refunds . 
An overpayment of income and social security taxes entitles you to a refund unless you indicate on the return that the overpayment should be applied to your succeeding year's estimated tax . 
If you file Form 1040A and the District Director computes your tax , any refund to which you are entitled will be mailed to you . 
If you file a Form 1040 , you should indicate in the place provided that there is an overpayment of tax and the amount you want refunded and the amount you want credited against your estimated tax . 
Refunds of less than $1 will not be made unless you attach a separate application to your return requesting such a refund . 
Where to file . 
Send your return to the Director of Internal Revenue for the district in which you have your legal residence or principal place of business . 
If you have neither a legal residence nor a principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district , your return should be filed with the District Director of Internal Revenue , Baltimore 2 , Md. . 
If your principal place of abode for the tax year is outside the United States ( including Alaska and Hawaii ) , Puerto Rico , or the Virgin Islands and you have no legal residence or principal place of business in any Internal Revenue district in the United States , you should file your return with the Office of International Operations , Internal Revenue Service , Washington 25 , D.C. . 
Adjusted gross income 
. 
The deductions allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income put all taxpayers on a comparable basis . 
It is the amount you enter on line 9 , page 1 of Form 1040 . 
Some deductions are subtracted from Gross Income to determine Adjusted Gross Income . 
Other deductions are subtracted only from Adjusted Gross Income in arriving at Taxable Income . 
To compute your adjusted gross income you total all items of income . 
( See Chapter 6 . 
) From this amount deduct the items indicated below . 
Businessmen deduct all ordinary and necessary expenses attributable to a trade or business . 
Rents or royalties . 
If you hold property for the production of rents or royalties you subtract , in computing Adjusted Gross Income , ordinary and necessary expenses and certain other deductions attributable to the property . 
( See Chapter 15 . 
) 
Outside salesmen deduct all expenses attributable to earning a salary , commission , or other compensation . 
( See Chapter 10 . 
) 
Employees deduct expenses of travel , meals and lodging while away from home in connection with the performance of their services as employees . 
They also deduct transportation expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services as employees even though they are not away from home . 
( See Chapter 12 . 
) If your employer reimburses you for expenses incurred , you deduct such expenses if they otherwise qualify . 
( See Chapter 10 . 
) 
Sick pay , if included in your Gross Income , is deducted in arriving at Adjusted Gross Income . 
If your sick pay is not included in your Gross Income , you may not deduct it . 
( See Chapter 9 . 
) income from estates and trusts . 
If you are a life tenant , you deduct allowable depreciation and depletion . 
If you are an income beneficiary of property held in trust or an heir , legatee , or devisee , you may deduct allowable depreciation and depletion , if not deductible by the estate or trust . 
Deductible losses on sales or exchanges of property are allowable in determining your Adjusted Gross Income . 
( See Chapter 20 . 
) 50% of capital gains . 
You also deduct 50% of the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses in determining Adjusted Gross Income . 
( See Chapter 24 . 
) other deductions . 
Certain other deductions are not allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income . 
They may be claimed only by itemizing them on page 2 of Form 1040 . 
These deductions may not be claimed if you elect to use the Standard Deduction or Tax Table . 
( See Chapters 30 through 37 . 
)

Minors minors must also file returns if they earn $600 or more during the year . 
A minor is subject to tax on his own earnings even though his parent may , under local law , have the right to them and might actually have received the money . 
His income is not required to be included in the return of his parent . 
A minor child is allowed A personal exemption of $600 on his own return regardless of how much money he may earn . 
Exemption also allowed parent . 
If your child is under 19 or is a student you may also claim an exemption for him if he qualifies as your dependent , even though he earns $600 or more . 
See Chapter 5 . 
Example . 
Your 16 year old son earned $720 in 1961 . 
You spent $800 for his support . 
Since he had gross income of $600 or more , he must file a return in which he may claim an exemption deduction of $600 . 
Since you contributed more than half of his support , you may also claim an exemption for him on your return . 
He may get a tax refund . 
A minor who has gross income of less than $600 is entitled to a refund if income tax was withheld from his wages . 
Generally , the refund may be obtained by filing Form 1040A accompanied by the withholding statement ( Form W-2 ) . 
If he had income other than wages subject to withholding , he may be required to file Form 1040 . 
See Chapter 1 . 
If your child works for you , you may deduct reasonable wages you paid to him for services he rendered in your business . 
You may deduct these payments even though your child uses the money to purchase his own clothing or other necessities which you are normally obligated to furnish him , and even though you may be entitled to his services . 
The one- or two-season hunt , of which there have been too many recently , may do more harm than good ; ; 
for such programs raise hopes of assistance toward achieving excellence in scholarship and the arts which are dashed when the programs are discontinued ; ; 
and they are dashed , no less , by lack of skill in making selections of men and women for development toward the highest reaches of the mind and spirit . 
For the making of selections on the basis of excellence requires that any foundation making the selections shall have available the judgments of a corps of advisors whose judgments are known to be good : such judgments can be known to be good only by the records of those selected , by records made subsequent to their selection over considerable periods of time . 
The central group of the Foundation's advisors are , at any one period of time , the members of our Advisory Board , consisting , now , of thirty-six men and women . 
They are chosen by the Foundation's Board of Trustees on the bases of their own first-rate accomplishments in their different fields of scholarship and the arts . 
Their locations in all parts of the United States , and their locations in the several kinds of educational and research institutions that are the principal homes of our intellectual and artistic strengths also are factors in the Trustees' minds . 
For this concept of an Advisory Board , ancillary to the Board of Trustees , we are indebted to the late President of Harvard University , A. Lawrence Lowell , a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institutions and their administration . 
That we had the wit and wisdom to adopt Mr. Lowell's concept and make it the base for our processes of selection is one reason why our selections have been , it may be said truly , pretty uniformly good . 
For , in accordance with Mr. Lowell's concept of an advisory board , our selections are made by experienced selectors who give both constancy and consistency to our processes and our choices . 
And lest we should become too consistent , in the sense of becoming heedless of new fields of scholarship and new points of view in the arts , the Foundation's Board of Trustees maintains a trickle -- not a flow ! ! 
-- of new members through the Advisory Board . 
Two committees of members of the Advisory Board constitute the committees of selection -- one for the selection of Fellows from Canada , the United States , and the English-speaking Caribbean area and one for the selection of Fellows from the Latin American republics and the Republic of the Philippines . 
To the members of our Advisory Board , and most specially to its members who constitute our committees of selection , the Foundation is indebted for its successes of choice of Fellows . 
We are , as we know , utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get ; ; 
and quality of advice , added to devotion to the Foundation's purposes and ideals , we do get from our Advisory Board in measures so full that they can be appreciated only by those of us who work here every day . 
But the facts about our Advisory Board and its members' duties are only one of several sets of facts about the quest for advice , both reliable and imaginative , on which to base our selections of Fellows . 
For example , the interest of past members of the Foundation's Advisory Board remains such that they place their knowledge and judgments at our disposal much as they had done when they were , formally , members of that Board . 
And , besides , there are a large number of scholars , artists , composers of music , novelists , poets , essayists , choreographers , lawyers , servants of government , and men of affairs -- hundreds , indeed -- who serve the Foundation well with the advice they give us freely and gratis out of their experience . 
To all , the Foundation gives the kind of thanks which are more than thanks : to them we are grateful beyond the possibility of conveying in words how grateful we are . 
It is a truism of business that no business can be better than its board of directors and its top management . 
The same is true of every foundation . 
During the biennium reviewed in this Report , our Board of Trustees named able men , younger than the rest of us , to the Board and to top management to insure future continuance of the first-class administration of the Foundation's affairs : 
Dr. James Brown Fisk , physicist , President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , was elected to the Board of Trustees . 
He is a member both of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Philosophical Society ; ; 
and he has served our country well as a scientific statesman on international commissions . 
Dr. Gordon N. Ray , Provost , Vice-President and Professor of English in the University of Illinois , was appointed Associate Secretary General . 
The Trustees of the Foundation appointed Dr. Ray to that position with the stated expectation that he would succeed the present Secretary General upon the latter's eventual retirement . 
Dr. Ray is a Fellow of the Foundation -- appointed thrice to assist his studies of William Makepeace Thackeray and of H. G. Wells -- and , before his appointment to the Foundation's executive staff , had been given our highest scholarly accolade , appointment to the Advisory Board . 
Referring further to the Foundation's officers , Dr. James F. Mathias , for eleven years our discerning colleague as Associate Secretary , was promoted to be Secretary . 
He is a historian , with the great merit of a historian's long view . 
Also appointed to the Foundation's staff , as Assistant Secretary , is Mr. J. Kellum Smith , Jr. . 
Mr. Smith , like the present Secretary General , is a lawyer ; ; 
and lawyers -- with the great virtues that they are trained to read `` the fine print '' carefully and are able out of professional experience to arrive at imaginative solutions to difficult problems in many fields -- are indispensable even in a foundation office . 
The present Secretary General has been the Foundation's principal administrative officer continuously since the Foundation's establishment thirty-five years ago . 
But even he will not last indefinitely and the above-noted new arrangements are , quite simply , made to assure qualitative continuity in the Foundation's policies and practices . 
The effective recognition of excellence and its nurture has to be learned and is not learned in a day , nor even in a year . 
We are not given to lamentations , neither personally nor in these Reports . 
On the contrary , if this be an apocalyptic era as is commonly said , we see it as an era of opportunity . 
For , granting that there are great present-day problems to be solved , these problems make great demands ; ; 
and by their demanding tend to create resources of men's minds and hearts which problems with easy answers do not bring forth . 
Of this , examples are legion : Pericles speaking his funeral oration in Ancient Greece's extremity after Thermopylae and making it a testament of freedom ; ; 
Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence amid the catastrophes of revolution ; ; 
Christ preaching the Sermon on the Mount , close to his ultimate sacrifice ; ; 
Shakespeare speaking with `` the indescribable gusto of the Elizabethan voice '' -- ; ; 
Keats's words -- in the days of the Spanish Armada's threats ; ; 
Isaac Newton , at the age of twenty-three , industriously calculating logarithms `` to two and fifty places '' during the great plague year in England , 1665 ; ; 
Winston Churchill's Olympian , optimistic and resolute sayings when Britain stood alone against the armed forces of tyranny less than twenty years ago ; ; 
the present-day explorations of outer space , answering age-old questions of science and philosophy , in the face of possible wars of extinction . 
Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit , as the Roman poet , Virgil , declared with much more historical sense than most writers of today . 
It gives , indeed , cause for rejoicing to remember what many catastrophes of the past produced ; ; 
and it is to be noted also that confidence should grow from remembering that great men often appeared in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind . 
For example , out of the social evils of the English industrial revolution came the novels of Charles Dickens ; ; 
and his genius moved his readers to seek solutions of those evils for all Western men -- until today -- , in the industrialized West , these social evils substantially do not exist . 
The solutions were not arrived at by any theoreticians of the Karl Marx stripe but by men of government -- lawyers , most of them -- and men of business . 
These were educated men , who , as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying , formed their inductions out of experience under the burden of responsibility . 
That is , to put it realistically , they had to run their businesses at a profit , or they had to get the votes to get elected . 
Nevertheless , they made naught of Marx's prophecy that capitalism would never pay the `` workers '' -- to use Marx's word -- more than a subsistence wage , with the consequence that increased productivity must inevitably find its way into the capitalists' pockets with the result , in turn , that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase . 
But as all understand who have eyes to see , nothing of the kind has happened ; ; 
indeed , the contrary has happened . 
The gulf between the `` rich '' and the `` poor '' has narrowed , in the industrialized Western world , to the point that the word `` poor '' is hardly applicable . 
And the reason this could happen is clear : men of government , business men , lawyers and all who concerned themselves with the welfare of their fellow men did not let their concern to run their businesses at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity . 
Some would say that they were not permitted to run their businesses only for profit ; ; 
and even putting it that way would not prove that Marx was anything but wrong . 
Sir Henry Sumner Maine , a hundred years before Communism was a force to be reckoned with , wrote his brilliant legal generalization , that `` the progress of society is from status to contract '' . 
The essence of contract is that one is free to make a choice of what one will or will not do . 
Hence , the condition of freedom is a necessary condition for choice . 
The greater the range of freedom for individual men , the greater the range of choice ; ; 
the greater the range of choice , the greater the rate of change . 
For change is dependent on the possibilities that individual men glimpse for the future . 
But when there is not freedom and opportunity to choose , men -- individual men -- must remain in status and society does not , cannot , progress . 
The eternal truth is that progress -- due , as it always is , to individual creative genius -- is just as dependent on freedom as human life is dependent on the beating of the heart . 
And lest anybody think that considerations such as these are not germane in a foundation report , let me enlighten them with the truths that , under Communism there would have been no capital with which to endow the Foundation , and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the Fellows might proceed , untrammeled in every way , toward their discoveries , their creative efforts for the good of mankind . 
During the year 1959 , we granted 354 Fellowships ; ; 
in 1960 , we granted 334 . 
As heretofore , our Fellowships are available to assist research in all fields of knowledge and creative effort in all the arts . 
We do not favor one field over another : we think that all inquiry , all scholarly and artistic creation , is good -- provided only that it contributes to a sense and understanding of the true ends of life , as all first-rate scholarship and artistic creation does . 
Indeed , if pressed , we would say what the late Robert Henri , American painter , said to a pupil , `` Anything will do for a subject : it's what you do with it that counts '' . 
Thus , we have no part , and want none , in current discussions of the relative importance of science , the social studies , the humanities , the creative arts . 
We want no part in such discussions , because we think them largely futile ; ; 
and we think them largely futile because , for true excellence of accomplishment , every scholar and every artist must cross boundaries of knowledge and boundaries of points of view . 
When the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company reached its 125th year as a going industrial concern during 1958 , it became an almost unique institution in the mechanical world . 
With its history standing astride all but the very beginnings of the industrial revolution , Brown & Sharpe has become over the years a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of its founder , Joseph R. Brown , and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology . 
Joseph R. Brown grew up in the bustle and enterprise of New England between 1810 and 1830 . 
He was early exposed to the mechanical world , and in his youth often helped his father , David Brown , master clock and watchmaker , as he plied his trade . 
At the age of 17 he became an apprentice machinist at the shop of Walcott & Harris in Valley Falls , Rhode Island , and following two or three other jobs in quick succession after graduation , he went into business for himself in 1831 , making lathes and small tools . 
This enterprise led to a father-and-son combination beginning in 1833 , under the name D. Brown & Son , a business which eventually grew into the modern corporation we now call Brown & Sharpe . 
The years of Joseph's partnership with his father were numbered . 
In 1838 , a devastating fire gutted their small shop and soon thereafter David Brown moved west to Illinois , settling on a land grant in his declining years . 
Joseph Brown continued in business by himself , quickly rebuilding the establishment which had been lost in the fire and beginning those first steps which were to establish him as a pioneer in raising the standards of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world . 
Much of his genius , of course , sprang from his familiarity with clock movements . 
During these early years the repair of watches and clocks and the building of special clocks for church steeples formed an important part of the young man's occupation . 
He became particularly interested in graduating and precision measurement during the 1840's , and his thinking along these lines developed considerably during this period . 
But his business also grew , and we are told that Mr. Brown found it increasingly difficult to devote as much time to his creative thinking as his inclinations led him to desire . 
It must have been with some pleasure and relief that on September 12 , 1848 , Joseph Brown made the momentous entry in his job book , in his characteristically cryptic style , `` Lucian Sharpe came to work for me this day as an apprentice '' . 
The young apprentice apparently did well by Mr. Brown , for in the third year of his apprenticeship Lucian was offered a full partnership in the firm ; ; 
the company became `` J. R. Brown & Sharpe '' , and entered into a new and important period of its development . 
Mr. Sharpe's arrival in the business did indeed provide what Mr. Brown had most coveted -- time for `` tinkering '' , and the opportunity of carrying out in the back room those developments in precision graduation which most interested him at that time . 
By 1853 , the new partnership announced the precision vernier caliper as the first fruit of their joint efforts . 
The basic significance of this invention helped them to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cutting and dividing engine . 
That development , in turn , formed the foundation of still more significant expansions in later years -- in gear cutting , in circular graduating , in index drilling , and in many other fields where accuracy was a paramount requirement . 
Throughout their careers , both Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe were interested in the problem of setting up standards of measurement for the mechanical trades . 
Several efforts were made in this direction , and though not all of them survive to this day , the Brown & Sharpe wire gage system was eventually adopted as the American standard and is still in common use today . 
As one development followed another , the company's reputation for precision in the graduating field brought it broader and broader opportunities for expansion in precision manufacture . 
In 1858 , the partnership began manufacturing the Willcox & Gibbs sewing machine . 
As the story goes , Mr. Gibbs , who originally came from the back counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia , saw an illustration in a magazine of the famous Howe sewing machine . 
Curious as to what made it work , he built a crude model of it in wood , and filed a piece of steel until he succeeded in making a metal pickup for the thread , enabling the crude machine to take stitches . 
When he showed this model as his `` solution '' as to how the Howe sewing machine operated , he was told he was `` wrong '' , and discovered to his amazement that the Howe Machine , which was unknown to him in detail , used two threads while the one that he had perfected used only one . 
Thus was invented the single thread sewing machine , which Mr. Gibbs in partnership with Mr. Willcox decided to bring to Brown & Sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake its manufacture . 
The new work was a boon to the partnership , not only for its own value but particularly for the stimulation it provided to the imagination of J. R. Brown toward yet further developments for production equipment . 
The turret screw machine , now known as the Brown & Sharpe hand screw machine , takes its ancestry directly from Mr. Brown's efforts to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sewing machine . 
Mr. Brown made important additions to the arts in screw machine design by drastically improving the means for revolving the turret , by introducing automatic feeding devices for the stock , and reversible tap and die holders . 
In 1861 , Mr. Brown's attention was called to yet another basic production problem -- the manufacture of twist drills . 
At that time , during the Civil War , Union muskets were being manufactured in Providence and the drills to drill them were being hand-filed with rattail files . 
This process neither satisfied the urgent production schedules nor Mr. Brown's imagination of the possibilities in the situation . 
The child of this problem was Mr. Brown's famous Serial No. 1 Universal Milling Machine , the archtype from which is descended today's universal knee-type milling machine used throughout the world . 
The original machine , bearing its famous serial number , is still on exhibition at the Brown & Sharpe Precision Center in Providence . 
During the Civil War period Mr. Brown also invented the Brown & Sharpe formed tooth gear cutter , a basic invention which ultimately revolutionized the world's gear manufacturing industry by changing its basic economics . 
Up until that time it had been possible to make cutters for making gear teeth , but they were good for only one sharpening . 
As soon as the time came for re-sharpening , the precise form of the gear tooth was lost and a new cutter had to be made . 
This process made the economical manufacture of gears questionable until some way could be found to permit the repeated re-sharpening of gear tooth cutters without the loss of the precision form . 
Mr. Brown's invention achieved this and , as a byproduct , formed the cornerstone of Brown & Sharpe's position of leadership in the gear making equipment field which lasted until the 1920's when superceded by other methods . 
The micrometer caliper , as a common workshop tool , also owes much to J. R. Brown . 
Although Mr. Brown was not himself its inventor ( it was a French idea ) , it is typical that his intuition first conceived the importance of mass producing this basic tool for general use . 
So it was that when Mr. Brown and Mr. Sharpe first saw the French tool on exhibition in Paris in 1868 , they brought a sample with them to the United States and started Brown & Sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day . 
The final achievement of Mr. Brown's long and interesting mechanical career runs a close second in importance to his development of the universal milling machine . 
That achievement was his creation of the universal grinding machine , which made its appearance in 1876 at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition . 
This machine , like its milling counterpart , was the antecedent of a machine-family used to this very day in precision metalworking shops throughout the world . 
Along with J. R. Brown's other major developments , the universal grinding machine was profoundly influential in setting the course of Brown & Sharpe for many years to come . 
Following Mr. Brown's death , there came forward in the Brown & Sharpe organization many other men who contributed greatly to the development of the company . 
One such man was Samuel Darling . 
As head of the firm Darling & Swartz , Mr. Darling began by challenging Brown & Sharpe to its keenest competition during the 1850's and early 60's . 
In 1868 , however , a truce was called between the companies , and the partnership of Darling , Brown & Sharpe was formed . 
Between that year and the buying out of Mr. Darling's interest in 1892 , a large portion of the company's precision tool business was carried out under the name of Darling , Brown & Sharpe , and to this day many old precision tools are in use still bearing that famous trademark . 
Perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of Mr. Brown's tradition for accuracy was Mr. Oscar J. Beale , whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of Mr. Brown , and whose particular forte was the development of the exceedingly accurate measuring machinery that enabled Brown & Sharpe to manufacture gages , and therefore its products , with an accuracy exceeding anything then available elsewhere in the world . 
Also important on the Brown & Sharpe scene , at the turn of the century , was Mr. Richmond Viall , Works Superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910 . 
Mr. Viall possessed remarkable talents for the leadership and development of men . 
He was an ardent champion of the Brown & Sharpe Apprentice Program and personal counselor to countless able men who first developed their industrial talents with the company . 
In one sense it can be said that one of the most important Brown & Sharpe products over the years has been the men who began work with the company and subsequently came to places of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad . 
Commencing with the death of Lucian Sharpe in 1899 , the name of Henry D. Sharpe was for more than 50 years closely interwoven with the destiny of the company . 
During his presidency , the company's physical plant was enormously expanded , and the length and breadth of the Brown & Sharpe machine tool line became the greatest in the world . 
During the early part of this century , the Brown & Sharpe works in Providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world . 
During these years the company's product line followed the basic tenets laid down by Mr. Brown . 
It expanded from hand screw machines to automatic screw machines , from simple formed-tooth gear cutting machines to gear hobbing machines and a large contract gear manufacturing business , from rudimentary belt-driven universal milling machines to a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type milling machines . 
In the grinding machine field , expansion went far from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders , surface grinders , and a wide variety of special and semi-special models . 
In 1951 , Henry D. Sharpe , Jr. succeeded his father and continued the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working equipment business . 
The company is still broadening its line and is now active on four major fronts . 
The Machine Tool Division is currently producing Brown & Sharpe single spindle automatic screw machines , grinding machines of many types , and knee and bed-type milling machines . 
Recently added is the Brown & Sharpe turret drilling machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool development . 
In the Industrial Products Division , the company manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment , machinists' tools -- including micrometers , Vernier calipers , and accessories . 
In the Cutting Tool Division , the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling cutters , end mills and saws . 
Sales and net income for the year ended December 31 , 1960 showed an improvement over 1959 . 
Net income was $2,557,111 , or $3.11 per share on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding , as compared to $2,323,867 or $2.82 per share in 1959 , adjusted to the same number of shares . 
Sales and other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960 . 
This increase was sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and increased expenditures on research and development . 
In spite of the fact that our largest market , the textile industry , was affected substantially by the current decline in business activity , we have been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially higher than during 1959 . 
Outlook for current year 
Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and unless this trend can be reversed , our production for 1961 will be lower than for 1960 . 
However , the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961 . 
Need for sound tax policy 
In connection with our continuing development of new and more efficient mill machinery , a sounder U. S. income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment , enabling the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic basis , could , if adopted , have favorable effects on Leesona's business in the next few years . 
Such a depreciation policy would also , we believe , prove a very important factor in strengthening the competitive position of the U. S. textile and other industries , thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange . 
Research and development 
Our research and development program , serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world , continues to have primary emphasis at Leesona . 
This program is based on the policy of designing and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile values -- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality , fashion and utility provide the consumer with better textile products for the money . 
Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing mill equipment , in terms of efficiency and versatility . 
But more important , we believe , it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine . 
Budget increased 
On this basis , our already substantial budget for research and development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's future growth in sales and earnings . 
Much of this necessary increase in research and development , though properly chargeable to current expenses , is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed and the new machines sold in quantity , usually over a period of several years . 
Stretch yarn machines 
In December we began to ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines . 
These machines produce the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured fabrics . 
During the past year , great progress has been made by the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics . 
Fashion centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and improved `` wash and wear '' dresses and blouses made from these fabrics . 
This machine , operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions per minute , is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations in industry today . 
It transfers yarn directly from the producers' largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics . 
Large-package twister 
Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing well in our customers' mills . 
Later in the year , additional types of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other man-made fibers and natural yarns . 
These machines are designed to provide higher operating speeds , larger yarn packages , and greater flexibility of application to different types of yarn . 
This we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment . 
Uniconer 
Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic coning machine . 
This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year . 
This machine was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and was well received by the industry . 
The potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder . 
The Uniconer has several outstanding features -- it operates with much greater efficiency than existing equipment ; ; 
it incorporates an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle , and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end is exhausted . 
Because the bobbin-to-cone winding process is a relatively high-cost operation for the mill , the almost complete automation provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile production , at the same time upgrading quality . 
Many mills have already placed firm orders for this machine . 
New Unifil application 
A new application for the Unifil loom winder , running single filling for box looms , will broaden mill use of this equipment . 
Take-up machines 
A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarns . 
It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to hold precise tension and speed . 
This new machine takes up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds up to 6,000 feet per minute . 
It is equipped with an automatic threading device to reduce waste and handling time . 
Our take-up machines and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing for application with new high polymer yarns , in several fiber producing plants . 
We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding field . 
Diversification plans 
We are interested in further diversification into other fields of capital goods , or components for industrial products , and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction . 
Patterson Moos research 
Our Patterson Moos Research Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells . 
The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee , Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation , has been important in this work . 
In addition to its major effort on fuel cells , Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry on research in other fields , both under contract for the Defense Department , other government agencies and for our own account . 
PMR is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman programs . 
We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie Generale De Telegraphie Sans Fil ( CSF ) of France for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials . 
The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing of such materials in the United States . 
Initially we will import the thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will manufacture in this country . 
There is a rapidly growing demand for this material , primarily from the military . 
Further research , we believe , will develop important commercial applications . 
A project for the Air Force has been completed in which the NAIR infrared detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous gases . 
We are initiating research on the use of solid state materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity . 
The rapid advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation . 
Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances , and select for development those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities . 
New plant facilities 
Early in August we broke ground for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick , Rhode Island , which will house our textile and coil winding machinery operations . 
Construction is well along , and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of this year . 
All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will be transferred to Warwick . 
Operations in the new plant should be producing efficiently early in 1962 . 
An architect's sketch of the new plant is shown on the front cover . 
The building will contain 430,000 square feet , approximately the same as our present plant . 
However , its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production capacity , permit more efficient manufacturing , and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance costs . 
A major consideration in the choice of the Warwick site , four miles from Cranston , was the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly skilled work force . 
We have entered into an agreement for the sale of the present Cranston properties , effective as soon as we have completed removal to our new plant . 
British subsidiary 
During the year our British subsidiary , Leesona-Holt , Limited , expanded its plant in Darwen , England , and added machine tool capacity . 
The operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant in the adjoining town of Heywood . 
Layout and equipment were modernized and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis . 
The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations . 
In addition , land has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future . 
Financial developments 
The new Warwick plant is being built at our expense and under our direction . 
It will be transfered on completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island , a non-profit organization , which will reimburse us for the cost of construction . 
We will then occupy the new plant under lease , with an option to purchase . 
These arrangements are , in our opinion , very favorable to Leesona . 
Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank . 
In addition to expenditures on the Warwick plant , we have invested approximately $1,961,000 for machinery and equipment at Cranston , and for new machinery , plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt , Limited . 
We believe that these improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which will fully justify the investment . 
Long term loans have been reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000 . 
Inventories increased $625,561 to $8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months . 
Thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position . 
Employee contracts 
In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May , 1959 , with the International Association of Machinists , AFL-CIO , wages of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May , 1960 , and pay levels for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately . 
In addition , Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodations . 
Personnel benefits 
In addition to direct salaries and wages , the Company paid or accrued during the year the following amounts for the benefit of employees : 
During the pension year ended December 31 , 1960 , 23 employees retired , making a total of 171 currently retired under the Company's pension plan . 
At December 13 , 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of Providence , as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions to qualified members of the plan , totaled $2,412,616 . 
The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of the population that began 20 years ago . 
Another growth factor is increased consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics that go with a rising standard of living . 
As in many other industries , rising costs and intense competition , both domestic and foreign , have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent years . 
Increased efficiency 
In textiles , as elsewhere , a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and higher productivity . 
As a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery , Leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production , yet maintain both quality and flexibility . 
Problems of shifting styles 
The problem of efficient production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel or home decoration . 
Production must be adjusted accordingly , at minimum cost and quickly . 
In addition , production machinery must in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increasing number of synthetics , as well as blends . 
Following the term of service in Japan , each emissary returns for a brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college community . 
The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support for this program . 
Musical activities 
the college was one of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life . 
Extensive facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining , under skilled direction , the Choir , the Orchestra , the Band , the Glee Club , and smaller ensembles of wind and string players . 
All students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations for which they qualify . 
Orchestra , Band , and Choir have auditions during the week preceding the first day of classes . 
The Glee Club is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for membership . 
In addition to the many appearances of these organizations throughout the college year , there are concerts by students of the music department , by members of the music faculty , and by visiting artists . 
Student musical organizations are the Knights of Carleton and the Overtones ( men's vocal groups ) , and the Keynotes ( a women's singing group ) . 
These student-directed organizations include eight to ten members each ; ; 
they perform at many campus social events . 
Religious activities 
from the founding of the College those responsible for its management have planned to provide its students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding the meaning and importance of religion . 
Courses are offered in ethics , the philosophy and history of religion , Christian thought and history , and the Bible . 
Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute to the moral and religious development of its students . 
A college service of worship is held each Sunday morning at eleven o'clock in the Chapel . 
The sermons are given by the College Chaplain , by members of the faculty , or by guest preachers . 
Music is furnished by the Carleton College Choir . 
Chapel services are held weekly . 
These services at which attendance is voluntary are led by the Chaplain , by the President of the College , by selected faculty members , students , and visitors . 
The service is brief and variety in forms of worship is practiced . 
A Sunday evening program provides theological lectures , music , drama , and films related to the issues of the Judeo-Christian tradition . 
Attendance is required at the College Service of Worship or at the Sunday Evening Program or at any regularly organized service of public worship . 
Each semester every student must attend ten of the services or religious meetings . 
Attendance at the Chapel Service is voluntary . 
Religious organizations include the groups described below . 
The Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. at Carleton are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry out their general purposes . 
Occasional meetings are held for the whole membership , usually with a guest speaker , while smaller discussion groups meet more frequently . 
The Associations sponsor many traditional campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new friendships , to broaden their interests , and to engage in worthwhile service projects . 
There are other organizations representing several of the denominational groups . 
Included are the following : Baptist Student Movement , Canterbury Club ( Episcopal ) , Christian Science Organization , Friends' Meeting for Worship , Hillel ( Jewish ) , Liberal Religious Fellowship , Lutheran Student Association , Newman Club ( Roman Catholic ) , Presbyterian Student Fellowship , United Student Fellowship ( Congregational-Baptist ) , and Wesley Fellowship ( Methodist ) . 
Student religious organizations are co-ordinated under the Religious Activities Committee , a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association . 
The Northfield churches include the following : Alliance , Congregational-Baptist , Episcopal , Lutheran ( Norwegian , Danish , Missouri Synod , and Bethel ) , Methodist , Moravian , Pentecostal , and Roman Catholic . 
Theater 
the purpose of producing plays at the College is three-fold : to provide the Carleton students with the best possible opportunity for theater-going within the limits set by the maturity and experience of the performers and the theatrical facilities available ; ; 
to encourage the practice of attending the theater ; ; 
and to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance . 
Dramatic activity at the College is organized and carried on by The Carleton Players , which is to say by all students who are so inclined to advance these aims . 
For the 1960-1961 season , The Carleton Players have announced Blood Wedding by Federico Garcia Lorca , The Knight Of The Burning Pestle by Beaumont and Fletcher and A Moon For The Misbegotten by Eugene O'Neill , with a pre-season production of The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams . 
Student workshop 
this workshop , located in Boliou Hall , provides facilities for students to work in ceramics , weaving , enameling , welding , woodworking , textile printing , printmaking , and lapidary . 
These extra-curricular activities are conducted under supervision of the Director of the Student Workshop . 
The workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week . 
A student organization , Bottega , is open to any student interested in increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic arts in their historical , technical , and productive contexts . 
The group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop . 
They are assisted and advised by members of the Art Department . 
Athletics 
the Athletic program at Carleton is considered an integral part of the activities of the College and operates under the same budgetary procedure and controls as the academic work . 
The physical education program for men recognizes the value of participation in competitive sports in the development of the individual student and aims to give every man an opportunity to enter some form of athletic competition , either intercollegiate or intramural . 
The same standards for admission , for eligibility to receive scholarships or grants-in-aid , and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students . 
A faculty committee on athletics , responsible to the faculty as a whole , exercises control over the athletic program of the College . 
It concerns itself with : 1 . 
The policies which govern the program 2 . 
The preservation of desirable balance between the athletic and academic programs of the College 3 . 
The approval of athletic schedules 4 . 
The maintenance of Midwest Conference eligibility standards 
Carleton is a member of the Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference and abides by its eligibility rules . 
In addition to these rules , Carleton has added the following : 1 . 
A student who while in attendance at Carleton College participates in an athletic contest during the school year , other than that sponsored by the College , shall be permanently ineligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics at Carleton College and will also face permanent suspension from the institution . 
The school year does not end for any student until he has completed his last examination of the semester . 
2 . 
A student to be eligible for the captaincy of any Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least 1.00 . 
The `` C '' club is composed of the men of the College who have won an official letter in Carleton athletics . 
The purpose of the Club is to promote better athletic teams at Carleton and to increase interest in them among the student body . 
This is done by encouraging the entire male student body to participate in either the intercollegiate or intramural sports program and by sponsoring the Carleton cheerleaders . 
Soccer Club . 
The Soccer Club was organized by undergraduate men interested in playing soccer and promoting the sport . 
Membership consists of both beginners and experienced players . 
Practices are held regularly and the schedule of games is prepared by the student coach and the officers of the club . 
Women's Recreation Association . 
This Association , organized in 1920 , is affiliated with the Athletic Federation of College Women . 
The purpose of the organization is to further the interest of women students in recreational activities as a means of promoting physical efficiency , sportsmanship , and `` play for play's sake '' . 
The Association is governed by a board made up of representatives from each of the four classes . 
Membership is open to any woman student in the College . 
Active groups sponsored by the organization include the Saddle Club , Orchesis , Golf Club , Tennis Club , and Dolphins . 
The Saddle Club , open to students proficient in horsemanship , presents the Annual Spring Riding Exhibition , and during the year it offers speakers , movies , breakfast rides , and trips to broaden their knowledge of the sport . 
Orchesis , for students interested in the modern dance , contributes to the May Fete and offers earlier in the year a modern dance demonstration . 
Tennis Club participates in a dual tennis tournament with the University of Minnesota each fall , and also sponsors a two-day state invitational tennis meet at Carleton in May . 
The Dolphins present a three-night water show the week of the May Fete . 
Under the auspices of the Women's Recreation Association , interclass competition is organized in badminton , basketball , field hockey , golf , tennis , and swimming . 
The Association participates in the winter sports carnival and sponsors several Play Days with St. Olaf and other nearby colleges . 
With the co-operation of the Department of Physical Education for Men , the Women's Recreation Association arranges mixed tournaments in tennis and golf in the fall and spring . 
Throughout the year there are social events , such as picnics , breakfast hikes , canoe trips , banquets , and indoor parties . 
College publications 
in addition to the miscellaneous pamphlets and other printed matter which it issues , the College maintains regular publications , as follows : 
The Bulletin , in five issues : The Report Of The President in August ; ; 
The Alumni Fund Report in September ; ; 
the Annual Catalog in March ; ; 
an Alumni Reunion Bulletin in April ; ; 
and a special Bulletin in June . 
The College also publishes each year The Report Of The Treasurer and a monthly newsletter entitled Carleton College Comments . 
In co-operation with the Alumni Association of Carleton College , an alumni magazine , The Voice Of The Carleton Alumni , is edited and mailed seven times a year by the College's Publications Office and the Alumni Office . 
At intervals an alumni directory is issued . 
These publications may be secured as follows : The Annual Catalog from the Director of Admissions and other issues from the Publications Office . 
In January , 1960 , the first issue of The Carleton Miscellany , a quarterly literary magazine , was published by the College . 
The magazine , edited by members of the Carleton Department of English , includes contributions by authors from both within and beyond the Carleton community . 
Student publications 
The Carletonian , the college newspaper , is edited by students and published by the College under the supervision of the Publications Board . 
( See page 100 . 
) It is issued weekly throughout the college year . 
The Publications Board holds annual competitive examinations for places on the editorial and business staffs . 
The editor , sports editor , and student business manager are chosen in December , the new staff assuming responsibility for the paper at the beginning of the second semester . 
The paper affords excellent practice for students interested in the field of journalism . 
The Algol , the college annual , is published in the fall of each year . 
The Algol serves as a record of campus organizations and student activities during the year . 
The Publications Board receives applications for the positions of editor and business manager and makes the appointments in the spring previous to the year of publication . 
Members of The Algol staff are nominated by the editor and business manager and appointed by the Publications Board . 
Manuscript , a quarterly literary magazine , is published by the students of the College . 
It is the purpose of this magazine to serve as an outlet for student creative writing . 
The editor and business manager of Manuscript are appointed by the Publications Board . 
Campus broadcasting station 
A low-power , `` carrier-current '' broadcasting station , KARL , heard only in the campus dormitories , is owned and operated by the students to provide an outlet for student dramatic , musical , literary , technical , and other talents , and to furnish information , music , and entertainment for campus listeners . 
Over a hundred students participate in the planning and production of the daily program schedule . 
KARL provides experience for students who wish to pursue careers in radio . 
Student government 
the Carleton Student Association includes all students in college and is intended `` to work for the betterment of Carleton College by providing student government and student participation with the college administration in the formulation and execution of policies which pertain to student life and activities '' . 
The Carleton Social Co-operative is a standing committee of the Carleton Student Association . 
Week-end activities for the entire campus are planned by the Co-op Board . 
In recent months , much attention has been given to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat divided as to the outlook for the near future . 
And yet , despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade , 1960 has been a good year in many ways , with many overall measures of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole . 
The shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution has probably been a good thing , in that it has prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized many previous swings in the business cycle . 
This caution has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier , and the fact stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level . 
In the electronics industry , this tendency is well illustrated by inventories of TV sets . 
Factory stocks in recent months have been the highest they have been in three years , while those at retail are below 1959 . 
The total value of our industry's shipments , at factory prices , increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.1 billion as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business -- home entertainment , military , industrial , and replacement . 
I believe a further gain is in prospect for 1961 . 
Home entertainment sales up 
Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as consoles and combinations since 1953 , dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion , compared to $1.7 billion in 1959 . 
Sales of TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months of 1959 through July ; ; 
set production ( excluding those destined for the export market ) also ran ahead in the early months , but was curtailed after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic . 
For the year as a whole , retail sales of TV sets probably came to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959 ; ; 
however , production came to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million . 
In contrast to the lower turnout of TV , total radio production increased from 15.4 million sets to 16.7 million ( excluding export ) . 
Both home and auto radios were in excellent demand , with retail sales of home sets ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven ; ; 
sales and production of home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units . 
Auto set production came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959 . 
Separate phonographs also had a good year , reflecting the growing popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterized the radio-TV market . 
The outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present , but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers to step up their buying plans for durable goods . 
I would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - 15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison , with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will . 
I look for TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 million sets for the year , but I look for some decline in radios from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0 - 15.5 million sets . 
I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8 million , slightly below 1960 , but above 1959 . 
Military electronics to grow 
1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's shipments of military electronics , which totalled about $5.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion in 1959 . 
It is interesting to note that the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953 , which were good years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period of rapid consumer acceptance . 
It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized the decade of the 1950's , and that our military markets may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas of our defense capability . 
While this may well be true in general , I believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding rapidly in other directions . 
Among the items scheduled for acceleration in the near future are the Polaris and B70 programs , strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic Air Command , and improved battlefield surveillance systems . 
Research and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile defense systems such as Nike-Zeus are expected to increase substantially . 
Research , development test and evaluation funds , devoted to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft , and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963 . 
Still later , the realm of space technology will show substantial gains ; ; 
it has been estimated that spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than $500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967 , and that the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer to 50% than the current 20% . 
The stepped-up defense procurement called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and the components that go into it , and it has been suggested that an additional $2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested for fiscal 1962 . 
Although the impact of these increases on our industry's shipments will be gradual , on balance I look for another good increase in shipments in the coming year , to at least $6 billion . 
Industrial electronic equipment 
Paced by the continuing rapid growth of electronic data processing , sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959 . 
The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand at the rate of about 30% annually , reaching some $450 million in 1960 . 
Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960's , under the stimulus of new applications in the fields of banking and retailing , industrial process control , and information storage and retrieval . 
In the industrial field , prospects for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment are also quite bright . 
For the near term , however , it must be realized that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive to general business conditions than is the military market , and for this reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller than those of recent years ; ; 
sales should slightly exceed 1960 , however , and reach $1.9 billion . 
Replacement parts 
In addition to the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business , the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues year by year . 
This is now a $1.0 billion business , up from $0.9 billion in 1959 , and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961 . 
The markets for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of the various end equipment segments of the industry . 
Demand for parts for home entertainment was strong in the first half , but purchases were cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced their own operating rates . 
In the military field , incoming orders turned down early in the year , and remained rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt in rising orders for components . 
Sales of transistors in 1960 exceeded $300 million , compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reductions in virtually all types . 
Production totalled about 123 million units against 82 million in 1959 , and I look for a further gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961 . 
Sales of passive components , such as capacitors and resistors , although not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 1959 this year , and should increase again in 1961 . 
In sum , I look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 , with total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion , despite the uncertainties in the business outlook generally . 
As I have indicated above , I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of the year , but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960 ; ; 
on prospects for continued increases in defense spending ; ; 
and on continued growth in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's .

Mr. Brown will at the same time undertake expansion of VecTrol's custom design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased engineering staff . 
Mr. Devey's new responsibilities are in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of Sprague's Special Products Group , which manufactures a wide line of digital electronic components , packaged component assemblies , and high temperature magnet wires . 
Mr. Devey first came to Sprague in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department , coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington , D. C. , where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare studies . 
During World War 2 , , he was a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy . 
Mr. Devey is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and attended the United States Naval Academy Post-Graduate School specializing in electronic engineering . 
He was named Product Manager of the Special Products Division of Sprague when it was founded in 1958 , and was later promoted to his present post . 
Mr. Devey is a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers , and is chairman of the Electronic Industries Association Committee on Printed and Modular Components . 
Mr. Brown , well-known , English-born inventor , prior to founding VecTrol was at various times section leader in radio research at Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co. , Ltd. ; ; 
chief engineer of the radio set division of Electric and Musical Industries , Ltd. , the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in Great Britain ; ; 
director of engineering at Philco of Great Britain , Ltd. , and vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president at The Brush Development Co. , Cleveland , Ohio . 
He has a Bachelor of Science from the University of Manchester , England . 
Mr. Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923 . 
He is a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers . 
He is a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers , London , a registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio , and a chartered electrical engineer in Great Britain . 
The promotion of Robert E. Swift to the position of Assistant Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department was announced early in December by Frederick S. Scarborough , Manager of Interference Control Field Service . 
The appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems . 
Between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters . 
Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential aide , one person , with adequate staff assistance , could fill both jobs . 
Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals rather than as employees , enthusiasm in a common enterprise is proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing in the decisions that govern its course . 
The faculty believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching and scholarship . 
The president expects faculty members to remember , in exercising their autonomy , that they share no collective responsibility for the university's income nor are they personally accountable for top-level decisions . 
He may welcome their appropriate participation in the determination of high policy , but he has a right to expect , in return , that they will leave administrative matters to the administration . 
How well do faculty members govern themselves ? ? 
There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in government . 
They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than to their own internal problems of government . 
They , too , need to learn to delegate . 
Letting the administration take details off their hands would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a whole , an area that would benefit by more faculty attention . 
Although faculties insist on governing themselves , they grant little prestige to a member who actively participates in college or university government . 
There are , nevertheless , several things that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who are willing to exercise their privilege . 
He can , for example , present significant university-wide issues to the senate . 
He can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various ways : by seeing to it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as well as the action-oriented faculty ; ; 
by making certain that no faculty member has too many committee assignments ; ; 
by assuring good liaison between the committees and the administration ; ; 
by minimizing the number of committees . 
Despite the many avenues for the exchange of ideas between faculty and administration , complaints of a lack of communication persist . 
The cause is as often neglect as hesitance to disclose . 
A busy president , conversant with a problem and its ramifications and beset by pressures to meet deadlines , tends naturally to assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is . 
The need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all methods of consultation . 
To increase faculty influence and decrease tension , many presidents have established a standing advisory committee with which they can discuss problems frankly . 
The president has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes , but if he looks ahead two , three , or five years to anticipate issues and throw out challenging ideas , he can open the way for innovation , and he can also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take . 
Success will require tact , sensitivity to faculty prerogatives , patience , and persistence . 
The critical task for every president and his academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance will match changing social demands . 
Great professors do not automatically reproduce themselves . 
Deans can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty . 
They serve not only as spokesmen for their areas , but they also contribute to top-level decision making . 
The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance . 
Faculty members depend on their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration . 
The administration at the same time , looks to the chairmen for strategic aid in building stronger departments . 
One way that this can be done , other than by hiring new high-priced professors , is by constantly encouraging the department members to raise their standards of performance . 
The quality of a president's leadership is measured first by his success in building up the faculty . 
By supporting the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever higher standards , the president can encourage faculty leadership . 
Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to . 
The academic dean should take a direct , long-term interest in faculty development . 
An alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs , plans for the future , qualifications of those on the job , and bright prospects elsewhere . 
For the maintenance of a long-term program , the departments , and particularly their chairmen , are strategic . 
They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and promotion . 
To provide an independent judgment for the president , the academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly . 
At some colleges and universities , a faculty committee reviews and reports to the administration on the qualifications of candidates . 
Some faculty members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because they either repeat department's actions or act pro forma . 
They can be effective , however , if their members set high standards for candidates and devote substantial time to the work . 
At one university , the president cites the faculty review committee as `` a valued partner of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the faculty '' . 
Before the president recommends a candidate to the trustees , the administration collects the views of colleagues in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere . 
The president or dean reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation of the quality of his mind . 
No good way to evaluate teaching ability has yet been discovered , although some institutions use inventory sheets for a list of criteria . 
To avoid passing over quiet , unaggressive teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion , review of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for advancement by their departments . 
There are certain aspects of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly . 
He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member proposed for tenure , to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements . 
No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to their specialties is quite different . 
In particular , the president may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale . 
On those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the standards of the institution , the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action . 
A true university , like most successful marriages , is a unity of diversities Without forcing all components into a single pattern , the preparation of a master plan is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest level , which a university -- in contrast to a multiversity -- should stand for . 
Recently colleges and universities have begun to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals . 
Each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as : Shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core for all undergraduates ? ? 
Or shall we permit early specialization in scientific and technological subjects ? ? 
In the first instance , adequate appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be planned . 
In the second , more shops , laboratories , and staff will be required . 
For the president , a master plan looking ahead five years ( the maximum reach for sound forecasting ) , offers several practical advantages . 
Trustees , faculty , and administration can consider the consequences of decisions before they are made , instead of afterwards . 
Physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed . 
Proposed new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present and future financial fitness . 
More than one president has found that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts . 
It inspires confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and to achieve them . 
Before deciding where it is going , however , a college or university must know where it is . 
The first step is a comprehensive self study made by faculty , by outside consultants , or by a combination of the two . 
It should sternly appraise curricula , faculty , organization , buildings , faculty work loads , and potential for growth in stature and size . 
Implementation of the master plan will inevitably be uneven . 
Some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically ; ; 
others may drag their feet . 
Funds may be readily donated for some purposes but not others . 
A plan must therefore be brought up to date periodically , possibly with the assistance of a permanent planning officer . 
To provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decisions , a number of institutions have established offices of institutional research . 
Some offices have very broad responsibilities , touching on almost all aspects of a university's instructional program . 
Their duties include evaluation of the information collected and preparation of recommendations . 
More often , these offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data . 
The president's opportunity for influencing education reaches its highest point , as he decides which projects he will cut back , which he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts . 
No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators , budget making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents . 
When the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget , to which his faith and credit are committed ; ; 
its principal features should be a product of his most considered judgment . 
He cannot , of course , examine each proposal from scratch . 
He reviews and shapes the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote the aims of the institution . 
Budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological scholarship . 
Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sums of money , an institution should choose its fields of prominence . 
Otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy , at worst , and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branches of learning . 
In the national interest even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses in all branches . 
Supporting activities -- business management , public relations , fund-raising -- offer presidents one of their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education . 
Here the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much to free a president for his primary role . 
In the areas that do not relate directly to the educational program , expert subordinates will serve the college or university better than close presidential attention . 
The president should find strong subordinates and delegate the widest discretion to them . 
Higher education cannot compete with the salary scales of the business world , but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business community that will offset the differences in income . 
Just as the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy and objectives , so should non-academic officers . 
They will better understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of mutual goals . 
A president is frequently besieged to serve in non-academic civic and governmental capacities , to make speeches to lay groups , and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus . 
Since he can neither accept nor reject them all , he must be governed by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations . 
Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance . 
By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues , the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to create a public perception of the university as an institution , something more than the lengthened shadow of one man . 
It was among these that Hinkle identified a photograph of Barco ! ! 
For it seems that Barco , fancying himself a ladies' man ( and why not , after seven marriages ? ? 
) , had listed himself for Mormon Beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said : `` With your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies '' ! ! 
Mills secured Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of Cal Barco . 
On their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants . 
Finally , at Ye Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado Avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to San Diego . 
They headed in that direction and , at San Juan Capistrano By-the-Sea came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old Spanish Mission Drive-in , eating a hot tamale . 
At the moment , Barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his convertible which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search . 
The robe , however , was missing , for by that time Barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in Glendale . 
The detectives placed Barco under arrest and , without informing him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning . 
Thus it was that Barco , apprehended for mere larceny , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered . 
During the return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` They're under sand dunes They're better off , I tell you I saved their souls '' . 
The detective , commenting on Barco's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged -- that he was a more or less harmless `` nut '' ! ! 
However while in his cell awaiting trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life . 
The attempt had failed because , when endeavoring to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood . 
The jail authorities -- attaching no particular significance to the episode -- offered Barco whisky to revive him ; ; 
but the old fellow , a lifelong teetotaler , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter . 
Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case . 
A man of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity . 
It was reported to Welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide . 
Welch wanted to know why . 
No one knew . 
Now Welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at . 
The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test . 
So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly : 
`` Barco , we've got the goods on you ! ! 
It'll be a lot better if you come clean '' . 
At first Barco was evasive and shifty . 
But with Welch's relentless pursuit of the subject , Barco finally `` broke '' and started confessing to one murder after another . 
By the time Barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true . 
But if true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into headlines all over America as the hero of a great murder trial . 
Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell . 
But to Welch's chagrin , the police captain pooh-poohed Welch's credulity in Barco's confession . 
Barco was clearly a `` nut '' . 
It required strength , bravado , daring to commit murder . 
`` That worm a murderer ? ? 
Ridiculous '' ! ! 
Then , for the first time since his arrest , a glint of spirit lit Barco's eyes . 
His manhood had been attacked . 
He stiffened and rose to his feet . 
He'd show them ! ! 
`` Is that so '' ? ? 
He queried . 
`` Well , for ten years I've been murdering women . 
I can lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ain't four , nor five , nor six of 'em -- there's seven ! ! 
'' 
The next day the police captain , in derision , organized what he termed `` Welch's Wild Goose Chase '' . 
For indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in Hollywood . 
The searching party consisted of the police captain , Welch , Barco , policemen with shovels , newspaper reporters , and cameramen . 
Barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on . 
He directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica . 
Stopping the cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills , and indicated a location . 
Orders were given to dig . 
Nothing was found . 
Welch was worried . 
The police captain chortled . 
The newspaper boys cracked jokes and again Barco's pride was aroused . 
With greater precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left . 
With quibs and gibes , the policemen again started digging . 
Welch was on edge . 
The captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object . 
`` There's something here '' ! ! 
Said the digger . 
Joking stopped and everyone gathered around . 
The digger , thrusting about with his shovel , now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's Hollywood sport shirts . 
Although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains , it was enough . 
Welch was wild with delight . 
His elation grew as Barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another . 
Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him . 
It went to his head , and his ambition increased . 
It was apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall and would use his power as D.A. to drag every possible sensation into the case . 
Every new scandal which would provide more `` copy '' for Marshall's pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch . 
I knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand . 
Once there , the D.A. with devilish cleverness would provide Marshall with headlines : `` Viola's Multiple Romances '' `` Viola Lake an Addict '' `` Downfall of Another Film Idol '' ! ! 
It would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl ! ! 
I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted . 
It wasn't long before I sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for Viola's destruction . 
He was bitter and resentful toward her , personally resentful . 
A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward Viola's favors -- or , even more serious perhaps , that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap . 
I did not rest until I had tracked the mystery down . 
Well , here it is . 
One day over a year before , there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel . 
Viola had been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone . 
She arrived late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; ; 
the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor . 
Naturally , Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival , in all politeness to her host . 
And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds ; ; 
while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as Fate would have it , belonged to District Attorney Welch . 
As Viola sat there , a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes . 
A little later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the Culture Forum on `` The Civic Spirit of the Southland '' , in the Byzantine room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the forum , was to preside . 
He made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed . 
Then , noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds , he made his way to the Byzantine room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the rostrum . 
The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined . 
The incident , aside from reflecting on Welch's political career , had all but wrecked his home life . 
He never rested until he discovered who the culprit was , and when he did , he vowed vengeance on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way . 
And here it was ! ! 
By such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion . 
During these first days of the trial I didn't have as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should have liked . 
In the first place , it was difficult for us to meet . 
We couldn't be seen together , for the tongue of Scandal was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent . 
I couldn't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her . 
Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her . 
There , Mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the Chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the Heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles ) . 
I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats . 
But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts . 
In fact , it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi . 
Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school . 
But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` chi-chi '' in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home . 
However , such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , alas , to my own mother . 
When I arrived at Viola's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen . 
Viola greeted me , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner . 
I sat and watched proceedings . 
There was to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself . 
I realized that Hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater . 
The most that was accomplished was adding Mrs. Beige's tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an ascending scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion . 
I was saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly . 
Here's a household hint : if you can't find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick up the phone . 
No matter if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their grandmother , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick up the phone . 
Jennie and Miranda twined themselves around me , murmuring endearments . 
Louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency . 
Somehow managing to get out a cool , poised , `` Won't you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including Devil's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia . 
I promised to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed . 
Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice . 
Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like Jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black out , Miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles . 
Under the circumstances , I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone , but when I hung up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening , and how important it was that Hank and I be there . 
I discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room . 
It seemed that I would be the gainer if I accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying out my threats . 
Resolving to get something done , I started in on the dishes . 
No . 
I'm not saying it right . 
What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink . 
They looked so formidable , however , so demanding , that I found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again , this time about Francesca and her husband . 
How about them , I thought . 
Francesca and Herbert were among the few people we knew in Catatonia . 
We didn't even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after I met Fran at a PTA meeting , and had taken us in hand socially . 
They had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; ; 
the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly thin ) . 
They were `` personalities '' . 
Herb , an expert on narrow ties , thin lapels , and swatches , was men's fashion editor of Parvenu , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation . 
Fran and he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from Nebraska , or was it Wyoming ? ? 
She was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and , having arrived in New York with a big bank roll , became a dabbler in various fields . 
She patronized Greenwich Village artists for awhile , then put some money into a Broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful ) . 
It was during her `` writing '' period that she and Herb met and decided that they were in love . 
They were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in Parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they honeymooned in Bermuda . 
No , not Bermuda . 
Bermuda was not in style that year . 
They had honeymooned in Rome ; ; 
everyone was very high on Rome that year . 
They had bought their house in Catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding New York ; ; 
they had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names . 
`` You are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , Fran had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but People Who Do Things '' . 
I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things . 
Their house was a centuries-old Colonial which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and updated , and added on to . 
It had a gourmet's corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a luncheon room , a dining room , a sitting room , a room for standing up , a party room , dressing rooms for everybody , even a room for mud . 
It was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time . 
Their two boys were `` well adjusted '' and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences . 
Francesca and Herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their Colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) . 
Fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by wearing Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in colors ; ; 
bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes . 
Sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid , unrelieved black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wearing this uniform , she strongly resembled a member of the SS. . 
No one could dislike them , I thought . 
Sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human . 
It seemed , indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement . 
Practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ; 
even brand names . 
You should hear the reverence in Fran's voice when she said `` Baccarat '' or `` Steuben '' or `` Madame Alexander '' . 
She always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy , and that Koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs . 
I wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally unreal . 
I couldn't feel at home among them . 
Besides Francesca , there was Blanche . 
Francesca was pleasant and charming , but Blanche was sweet . 
Yes , Blanche was very , very sweet -- being in her company was like being drowned in warm , melted marshmallows . 
I had once been a witness when Blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness , `` Oh , my souffle has collapsed '' . 
Anyone knows how a real , red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe ! ! 
If Blanche had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , valueless things . 
But dear me , no ; ; 
not Blanche . 
After five minutes with Blanche , one might welcome the astringency of Grazie , who was a sort of Gwen Cafritz to Francesca's Perle Mesta . 
Francesca and Grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen , equal bosses , of whatever PTA or civic project was being launched . 
They were inseparable , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen rivals for social leadership . 
Grazie was mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , unfunnily sarcastic . 
She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive . 
Grazie had a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast . 
She lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration , appointments , paint , and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring ; ; 
the pets were a couple of Siamese cats . 
Her uniform was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , housepaint , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless , she rather resembled a frozen fish stick . 
The husbands of these women and others I had met in Catatonia were distinguished only in that they were , to me at least , indistinguishable . 
I couldn't tell one from the other . 
Like Herbert , they were all in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising . 
One or two were writers of books ; ; 
all were fellows of finite charm . 
Each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and the habit of saying `` zounds '' ! ! 
In deference to country-squirehood . 
I never thought I'd live to hear people chuckle and say `` zounds '' ! ! 
In real life . 
I wouldn't have missed it for anything . 
They were `` sincere '' -- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile . 
These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gazed , misty-eyed with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting . 
Could such unadulterated love , for a total stranger , be credited ? ? 
They were always leaping to light cigarettes , open car doors , fill plates or glasses , and I mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that I mistrusted bake shops that called themselves `` Sanitary Bake Shops '' . 
`` O ! ! 
Pioneers ! ! 
'' I thought , and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier ; ; 
pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister '' . 
I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85,000 yearly ; ; 
people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ; 
people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; 
who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . 
In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ; 
well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! ! 
Reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . 
They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . 
Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand . 
I made plans for the afternoon -- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once , making the beds , and then maybe painting the kitchen . 
Then , I remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week . 
`` Bananas '' ! ! 
Jennie had shouted each time . 
`` They're not dessert ! ! 
They're not even food . 
They're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast '' . 
I dug around and found a mix , and was able to surprise them with a devil's-food cake with chocolate icing . 
( Sometimes I think you need only one rule for cooking : if you can't put garlic in it , put chocolate in it . 
) 
The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills Mama had been providing . 
Then Jennie closed her eyes , stretched forth her arms , and said : `` Take my hand , Louise ; ; 
I'm a stranger in paradise '' . 
Needless to say , I was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise . 
How dared they demand to `` snoop '' in private financial records , disbursements , confidential contracts and agreements ? ? 
`` It is as though '' , I said on the historic three-hour , coast-to-coast radio broadcast which I bought ( following Father Coughlin and pre-empting the Eddie Cantor , Manhattan Merry-go-round and Major Bowes shows ) `` That Man in the White House , like some despot of yore , insisted on reading my diary , raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie ! ! 
'' My impassioned plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the Eddie Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis . 
But what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation ? ? 
The savage barbarian hordes of red Russian Communism descended on the Athens that was mighty Metronome , sacking and despoiling with their Bolshevistic battle cry of `` Soak the rich ' ! ! 
After an unspeakable siege , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` owed '' the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I legally inherited as Morris' helpless relict , was `` stung '' with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to `` wipe out '' all but a fraction of my poor , hard-come-by savings . 
I was also publicly reprimanded , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as The New Republic , The New Yorker , Time and The Christian Science Monitor . 
It was then that I availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional . 
The litigation was costly and seemingly endless . 
I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court ( 1937 ) , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` henchmen '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me . 
Presidential coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers , `` toadies '' and sycophants of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me ! ! 
I was ready , like Portia , to present my own brief . 
But the Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case ! ! 
My plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out '' . 
Again , my name was on all the front pages . 
I was , it seemed , persona non grata in every quarter , but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence . 
As Charles Evans Hughes said , `` Miss Poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a litigant '' . 
Albert Einstein was quoted as saying : `` The workings of the woman's mind amaze me '' . 
Henry Ford spoke of me as `` utterly astounding '' . 
Heywood Broun wrote : `` Belle Poitrine is the most original thinker since Caligula '' , and even F.D.R. had to concede that `` if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss Poitrine , America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh '' . 
Not only were the court costs prohibitive , but I was subjected to crippling fines , in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid `` debts '' which the government claimed that Metronome and I owed -- a severe financial blow . 
Nor , as Manny said , had the notoriety done my career `` any good '' . 
My enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` robber baroness '' , and even `` traitor '' ! ! 
Traitor indeed ! ! 
I point now with pride to the fact that , long ere the Committee on Un-American Activities , the Minute Women , the Economic Council and other such notable `` watchdog '' organizations were so much as heard of , I was Hollywood's leading bulwark against communism , fighting single-handedly `` creeping socialism '' against such insuperable odds as the Fascio-Communist troops of the NRA , PWA , WPA , CCC and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries whom F.D.R. employed secretly , through the transparent ruse of regular `` relief '' checks . 
Needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period . 
Could it do otherwise ? ? 
Even though I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled . 
Such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to `` Oscar '' winning performances . 
I tried my hardest , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe . 
Having ( through my unflagging effort and devotion ) achieved stardom , a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all . 
Never a `` quick study '' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow thespians -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss Poitrine's co-star and `` helpmate '' had never learned his part . 
Each time Letch `` went up '' in his `` lines '' , I was the one to be patient , helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , blaming others , going into `` sulks '' and , on more occasions than I care to count , storming off the `` set '' for the rest of the day . 
As for his finances , I was never privileged to know exactly how much money Letch had `` salted away '' . 
It was I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even Letch's bills at his tailor and the Los Angeles Athletic Club . 
Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw . 
( But that is another story . 
) As for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipated in drinking , gaming and carousing . 
More than once I was confronted by professional gamblers , `` bookies '' , loan `` sharks '' , gangsters , `` thugs '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to repay my husband's staggering losses , `` or else '' I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu . 
And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children ! ! 
Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband . 
`` Ah , you're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' . 
Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter . 
I now felt it wiser to keep Baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around . 
Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . 
( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory . 
It almost always works out for the best . 
) 
Yet I adored this man , Letch Feeley , why , I cannot say . 
With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse . 
The times I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him -- lovely dinner parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host's chair was vacant ; ; 
a `` splash party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ; 
a lovely Epiphany party at Errol Flynn's , on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown `` starlet '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could . 
These are but a sampling of the insults I endured . 
As Mrs. Letch Feeley , was it any wonder that I , once the social arbiter of Filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires , the Coopers , the Gables , the Colmans , the Rathbones , the Taylors , the Thalbergs and such devout , closely knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys ? ? 
As Letch's antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable `` screenland '' gathering . 
Between 1935 and 1939 Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it . 
Our last joint venture , Sainted Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother Cabrini , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of America's first saint in November , 1938 , was a fiasco from start to finish . 
As I was playing Mother Cabrini , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me . 
But in order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing ruffian who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother Cabrini . 
And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? ? 
Did he trouble to memorize the very small part which I had `` tailor-made '' to his specifications , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ? ? 
Did he show the rest of the cast -- numbering four thousand -- the consideration of arriving at the studio punctually -- or even at all ? ? 
He did not ! ! 
The `` shooting '' went on for eight months ! ! 
Most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` bookies '' , illegal gambling dens , a certain `` residential club for young actresses '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club . 
Whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , uncooperative , rude and insulting . 
He made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general . 
By the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent , war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother Cabrini . 
Thanks to Letch Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable . 
Only George Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss Poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood '' . 
But it was small consolation . 
In a rare fit of anger and spite , I `` farmed out '' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment . 
( An actor must have discipline . 
) The film was called The Diet of Worms , which I felt was just what Letch deserved . 
It turned out to be a life of Martin Luther , of all things ! ! 
It was a disaster ! ! 
In clothes , Letch simply did not project . 
He was laughed off the screen . 
At the same time , however , I availed myself of the services of that great English actor and master of make-up , Sir Gauntley Pratt , to do a `` quickie '' called The Mystery of the Mad Marquess , in which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac . 
It was a `` potboiler '' made on a `` shoestring '' and not the sort of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal . 
My heart was not in it , but , oddly enough , it remains the most financially successful picture of my career . 
( I watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later . 
) 
Letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before . 
I really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to Momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me . 
`` If I could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy '' , I said . 
`` What is Letch interested in '' ? ? 
`` Bookies , booze and babes '' , Momma said bluntly . 
Her reply stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference . 
`` I can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , I said . 
Up to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it . 
It wasn't his fault that these things were so . 
The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately . 
As a result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready . 
Once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted . 
Then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs . 
His dogs ? ? 
He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams . 
Then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws . 
Dogs did something to one's ego . 
They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys . 
Regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference . 
Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture . 
What in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons ? ? 
You certainly couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns . 
Why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? ? 
It worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day . 
He would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it . 
How in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case ? ? 
Was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? ? 
Could it be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ? ? 
Or was the answer less metaphysical ? ? 
Did older people work more slowly ? ? 
Did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? ? 
Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ? ? 
It might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes . 
Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it . 
And then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them . 
There was no compulsion behind them . 
They could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn . 
During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done . 
This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting . 
He looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch . 
It was five minutes after four . 
On some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered . 
He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn . 
At least he could buy the equipment for his workshop . 
Thus committed , action might follow . 
He went down to Mills and Bradley's Hardware Store and bought a full set of carpenter's tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they were . 
He also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nails , levels and T squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for . 
`` There '' , said Mr. Mills . 
`` That'll get you started . 
Best not to get everything at once . 
Add things as you find you need 'em '' . 
He didn't even ask the cost of this collection . 
After all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . 
When he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , Jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car . 
He was glad . 
It gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments . 
He had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable . 
He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall . 
That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools . 
In front of it would be his workbench . 
The old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away . 
How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? ? 
How did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? ? 
After the pegboard there would be the paneling . 
He sat down on an old box and focused on the problem . 
Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget . 
But then , when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again ? ? 
It all seemed rather hopeless . 
He turned his attention to the workbench . 
Perhaps that was the first thing to do . 
A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? ? 
Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench . 
They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . 
Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot . 
How could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? ? 
Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about . 
Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on . 
After that everything should be simpler . 
He went upstairs to phone Crumb . 
To his amazement he reached him . 
Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold . 
He didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly . 
The only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job . 
That was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch . 
No , he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter . 
There wasn't any such thing any more . 
Carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job . 
There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way . 
Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk . 
Mr. Crumb would probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night . 
If he was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie . 
Mr. Blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into Mr. Crombie's life since he moved to Highfield , in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him . 
He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you . 
So Mr. Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. Blatz's mind from funny things . 
At the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance . 
While Mr. Blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench , Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar . 
Mr. Blatz agreed that this would be pretty . 
Without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste . 
`` Now '' , he said , `` we got to put in some outlets for them power tools ; ; 
then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' I guess we're about through down here '' . 
It all did look very efficient and shipshape . 
There was no question of that . 
`` By the way '' , said Mr. Blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power tools needs extra voltage . 
I guess you know about that . 
Before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits . 
That ain't too bad 'ceptin' the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin' '' . 
Instead of being depressed by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved . 
At least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools . 
He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs . 
As usual , Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils . 
Mr. Blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . 
`` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there . 
He oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions '' . 
Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . 
`` I was just sayin' to him that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' . 
Mr. Crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing . 
`` Oh , that's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie . 
`` I have a thousand things for you to do . 
Doors that won't open , and doors that won't close and shelves and broken -- '' 
`` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr. Crombie . 
`` Those are the things I can do , now that I'm set up '' . 
`` I've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . 
`` We won't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- there'll be plenty more '' . 
But the discussion was academic . 
Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink . 
Ambiguity 
Nothing in English has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences . 
Ben Franklin said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. Fogg . 
You explain English by Greek '' . 
Richard Brinsley Sheridan said , `` I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' . 
And a witty American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning '' . 
There are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies . 
In common parlance they would be described as misses -- misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds . 
One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition . 
`` Did you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane said you never said what I said '' ? ? 
Another woman , addressing Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we '' ? ? 
Such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours . 
Ambiguity of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in . 
`` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend . 
`` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have misunderstood me '' . 
Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women . 
Another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician . 
`` Mr. Jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement . 
Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it '' ? ? 
Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician . 
They recall Byron's classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' . 
Similarly , when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in cryptic fashion , Lincoln refused to make any further statement . 
`` I fear explanations explanatory of things explained '' , he said , leaving the biter bit -- and bitter . 
The obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks . 
`` Senator '' , said an interviewer , `` your constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' . 
`` Good '' ! ! 
Replied the Senator . 
`` It took me five hours to write it that way '' . 
The misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach . 
This creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word . 
A verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain : `` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a drunken spree . 
Now can you tell me who was drunk -- The man , his wife , or me '' ? ? 
The `` wooden-leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , had endless variations . 
`` There's a man outside with a wooden leg named Smith '' . 
`` What's the name of his other leg '' ? ? 
Another stock vaudeville gag ran : `` Mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' . 
When radio came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device . 
`` Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on '' ? ? 
`` I see the girl but I don't see the car with slacks on '' . 
In recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline . 
In one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman : `` Excuse me , but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter's handbag and my wife's behind '' . 
Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips . 
Not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than Af inches '' . 
Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions . 
Readers of the Reader's Digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a California paper that advertised `` House for rent . 
View takes in five counties , two bedrooms '' . 
Since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples . 
`` Officials Meet on rubbish . 
Many Shapes in bathtubs . 
Son and Daughter of Local Couple Married '' . 
Apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese , journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter . 
A weekly newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last Saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays '' . 
An item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription , adding : `` I personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband '' . 
Then there was the caterer's ad which read : `` are you getting married or having an affair ? ? 
We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' . 
The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical . 
This slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous English always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say . 
Samples : He walked in upon her invitation . 
She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance . 
He kissed her back . 
Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese . 
In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . 
`` While Henry Morgan was escorting Miss Vera Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr. Morgan on the public square '' . 
Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` The area in which Miss N -- was injured is spectacularly scenic '' . 
The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields . 
When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach '' . 
Strangely enough , this always brought the house down . 
Apart from journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature . 
A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor . 
Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case . 
It read : `` Shot in the lumbar region '' . 
After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the record : `` Shot in the woods '' . 
There are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations . 
At the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving . 
`` I want the fish served whole , with head and tail '' , the epicure explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' . 
The maid demurred . 
`` That's silly -- lemon in mouth '' , she said . 
But since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners , the girl reluctantly agreed . 
So she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth . 
Another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store . 
She said to the saleslady , `` I want a dress to put on around the house '' . 
The puzzled saleslady inquired , `` How large is your house , Madam '' ? ? 
This saleslady was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department . 
When a customer asked for alligator shoes , she said , `` What size is your alligator '' ? ? 
The comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy . 
One species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person , place , time or thing . 
A woman met a famous author at a literary tea . 
`` Oh , I'm so delighted to meet you '' , she gushed . 
`` It was only the other day that I saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' . 
This baffling lack of distinct details recalls the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence . 
`` I may be back '' , he explained , `` and then again , I may not '' . 
The girl nodded understandingly . 
`` Yes , sir '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ? ? 
An old-fashioned mother said to her modern daughter , `` You must have gotten in quite late last night , dear . 
Where were you '' ? ? 
The daughter replied , `` Oh , I had dinner with -- well , you don't know him but he's awfully nice -- and we went to a couple of places -- I don't suppose you've heard of them -- and we finished up at a cute little night club -- I forget the name of it . 
Why , it's all right , isn't it , Mother '' ? ? 
Her woolly-minded parent agreed . 
`` Of course , dear '' , she said . 
`` It's only that I like to know where you go '' . 
No less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman's sermon . 
`` Dearly beloved '' , he preached , `` unless you repent of your sins in a measure , and become converted to a degree , you will , I regret to say , be damned to a more or less extent '' . 
This clergyman should have referred to Shakespeare's dictum : `` So-so is a good , very good , very excellent maxim . 
And yet it is not . 
It is but so-so '' . 
Indefinite reference also carries double-meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another . 
A news item described the launching of a ship : `` Completing the ceremony , the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . 
This is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor pool : `` Four trucks to Fort Mason gym , 7:30 tonight , for hauling girls to dance . 
The bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off '' . 
A politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died . 
`` What are my chances for taking Joe's place '' ? ? 
He asked . 
`` If you can fix it up with the undertaker '' , returned the politician , `` it's all right with me '' . 
The manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite . 
`` What have you got on today '' ? ? 
She inquired . 
`` A blue suit '' , he answered . 
`` Who's in it '' ? ? 
She continued . 
`` I am '' , he said . 
There was a short pause for reflection . 
`` Oh '' , said the woman , `` I've seen that picture already '' . 
Another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb . 
When a question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered . 
The moonlit night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time . 
Finally he asked , `` Do you object to petting '' ? ? 
`` That's one thing I've never done '' , she said promptly . 
He thought a moment , then inquired , `` You mean petted '' ? ? 
`` No '' , she smiled , `` objected '' . 
Replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre . 
It would be hard to find anything more equivocal than : `` I cannot recommend him too highly '' . 
Another less ambiguous case read as follows : `` The bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction . 
If you are thinking of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' . 
In the comedy of indefinite reference , it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . 
Ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference . 
Two friends were talking . 
One said , `` When I get a cold I buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a few hours it's gone '' . 
The speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold . 
It-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit . 
An excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone : `` Doctor , please come over right away . 
My husband is in great pain . 
I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic -- his mother was born in Ohio -- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson Downs , raising hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such as human stature , hope , and humor . 
My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . 
After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . 
A bee's place is in the hive '' . 
`` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . 
`` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live . 
Did you go to their funeral '' ? ? 
`` I was wrong '' , I admitted . 
`` Comedy didn't die , it just went crazy . 
It has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate . 
We now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes , magazines known as Horror Comics , and sick comedians . 
There are even publications called Sick and Mad . 
The Zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a March hare ; ; 
it is manic as a man '' . 
`` I woke up this morning '' , Moreland said , `` paraphrasing Lewis Carroll . 
Do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? ? 
`` Can I bear it '' ? ? 
I asked , taking a final gulp of my drink , and handing him the empty glass . 
`` Just barely '' , he said , and repeated his paraphrase : `` The time has come '' , the walrus said , `` To speak of manic things , Of shots and shouts , and sealing dooms Of commoners and kings '' . 
Moreland fixed us each another drink , and said , `` For God's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' . 
`` I'll try '' , I said , and sat for a moment thinking . 
`` Oh yes , the other day I reread some of Emerson's English Traits , and there was an anecdote about a group of English and Americans visiting Germany , more than a hundred years ago . 
In the railway station at Berlin , a uniformed attendant was chanting , ' Foreigners this way ! ! 
Foreigners this way ' ! ! 
One woman -- she could have been either English or American -- went up to him and said , ' But you are the foreigners ' '' . 
I took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` I admit that going back to Ralph Waldo Emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy '' . 
`` What's the matter with the music '' ? ? 
Moreland asked . 
`` It doesn't drown out the dialogue '' , I explained . 
`` Let's talk about books '' , Moreland said . 
`` I am told that in America you have non-books by non-writers , brought out by non-publishers for non-readers . 
Is it all non-fiction '' ? ? 
`` There is non-fiction and non non-fiction '' , I said . 
`` Speaking of nonism : the other day , in a story about a sit-down demonstration , the Paris Herald Tribune wrote , ' The non-violence became noisier . 
And then Eichmann was quoted as saying , in non-English , that Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews was nonsense '' . 
`` If we cannot tell evil , horror , and insanity from nonsense , what is the future of humor and comedy '' ? ? 
Moreland asked , grimly . 
`` Cryptic '' , I said . 
`` They require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? ? 
In our present era of Science and Angst , the heart has been downgraded , to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs '' . 
`` I know what you mean '' , Moreland sighed . 
`` Last year your Tennessee Williams told our Dilys Powell , in a television program , that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart . 
Like almost everybody else , he confused the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the deranged glands , and the jumpy central nervous system . 
I'm not pleading for the heart that leaps up when it beholds a rainbow in the sky , or for the heart that with rapture fills and dances with the daffodils . 
The sentimental pure heart of Galahad is gone with the knightly years , but I still believe in the heart of the George Meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks '' . 
`` We no longer have Tom Moore's and Longfellow's ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , I said . 
`` Moore and Longfellow didn't have the fate that faces us '' , Moreland said . 
`` One day our species promises co-existence , and the next day it threatens co-extinction '' . 
We sat for a while drinking in silence . 
`` The heart '' , I said finally , `` is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes . 
When it was worn in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at least knew where it was '' . 
There was a long silence . 
`` You have visited England five times in the past quarter-century , I believe '' , my host said . 
`` What has impressed you most on your present visit '' ? ? 
`` I would say depressed , not impressed '' , I told him . 
`` I should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas , involving clergymen and parishioners , psychiatrists and patients . 
It is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political arenas from the modern theatre '' . 
`` Do you think we need a new Henry James to re-explore the Anglo-American scene '' ? ? 
He asked . 
`` Or perhaps a new Noel Coward '' ? ? 
`` But you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of James and the antic heyday of Coward . 
I myself hear it said constantly -- in drawing-rooms . 
In them , there is usually a group of Anglo-Americans with tragicomic problems , worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire '' . 
I stood up and began pacing . 
`` If you are trying to get us out of the brothel , the dustbin , the kitchen sink , and the tawdry living-room , you are probably wasting your time '' , Moreland told me . 
`` Too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock '' . 
`` Furiouser and furiouser '' , I said . 
`` I am worried about the current meanings of the word funny . 
It now means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor ; ; 
disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny ; ; 
and frightening , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights '' . 
Moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which I made each of us a new drink . 
He took his glass , clinked it against mine , and said , `` Toujours gai , what the hell '' ! ! 
Borrowing a line from Don Marquis' Mehitabel . 
`` Be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change . 
It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said . 
`` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance . 
Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' . 
My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; 
then he turned to me . 
`` Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? ? 
`` Oh , that is demonstrable '' , I told him . 
`` Do you remember the woman in the French Alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously ? ? 
She told the sheep , ' The world is coming to an end ' ! ! 
And the sheep said -- all in unison , I have no doubt -- ba-a-a ! ! 
The sound mockery of sheep is like the salubrious horse laugh '' . 
`` That is only partly non-nonsense '' , he began . 
`` If you saw the drama called Rhinoceros '' , I said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros . 
The rhinos would panic , screaming help ! ! 
-- if that can be screamed in their language '' . 
`` You think the Russians are getting ahead of us in comedy '' ? ? 
Moreland demanded . 
`` Non-God , no '' , I said . 
`` The political and intellectual Left began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such as satire and irony , such as humor and comedy . 
Nevertheless , like any other human being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually , Khrushchev , the anti-personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has . 
In his famous meeting with Nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed Wynn . 
But , like Caesar , he has only one joke , so far as I can find out . 
It consists in saying , ' That would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage . 
Why in the name of his non-God doesn't he vary it a bit '' ? ? 
`` Such as '' ? ? 
Moreland asked . 
`` Such as ' sending the cat to guard the mice ' , or ' the falcon to protect the dove ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human being to save humanity ' '' . 
`` You and I have fallen out of literature into politics '' , Moreland observed . 
`` What a nasty fall was there '' ! ! 
I said . 
Moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again , and then came back and sat down , restively . 
`` The world that was once foot-loose and fancy-free '' , he said , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy-free . 
In our age of Science and Angst it seems to me more brave to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space '' . 
`` The human ego being what it is '' , I put in , `` science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats . 
It seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species '' . 
`` Now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again '' , Moreland protested . 
`` Not in the largest sense of the words '' , I said . 
`` The other day Arnold Toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else . 
Why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else ? ? 
Forty years ago an English writer , W. L. George , dealt with this subject in Eddies of the Day , and said , as an example , that ' Saint George for Merry England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' Strike frog-eating Frenchmen dead ' '' ! ! 
`` There was also Gott strafe Angleterre '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and Carthago delenda est , or if you will , Deus strafe Carthage . 
It isn't what the ideologist believes in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy . 
This is the force , in our time and in every other time , that urges the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state . 
Complete power not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad . 
There is a bitter satire for a future writer in that '' . 
`` Great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , I said . 
`` But we now find writers obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and non-poetry . 
I wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about . 
One day , the children had wanted to get up onto General Burnside's horse . 
They wanted to see what his back felt like -- the General's . 
He looked so comfortable being straight . 
They wanted to touch the mystery . 
Arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by . 
He was very rude . 
Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time . 
The policeman's eyes rather popped for a second ; ; 
but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it wasn't for these dear children '' -- . 
The policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` Now , look here , lady : I know you got to entertain these kids and all . 
But this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' . 
Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' . 
The policeman walked on , but he looked back once . 
That had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred . 
Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ; 
and they had told their mother about the tumbles . 
In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ; 
and so they were consistently true to their principles . 
`` Never mind '' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups . 
`` Never mind . 
I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . 
`` What is it '' ? ? 
Asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable . 
Maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene . 
`` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British movie . 
And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time . 
First , Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults . 
They had protested that that wasn't any surprise . 
`` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement . 
`` This is a warm-up '' . 
`` Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ? 
Asked one of the children . 
`` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped . 
One of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions . 
Those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest . 
She would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously . 
But not hard for very long . 
Just long enough to make you feel important . 
`` Now '' , said Arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable . 
`` Now , we're going to be like what General Burnside and his horse make us think of '' . 
The children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever . 
Their curiosity went happily out of bounds . 
Then , Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful . 
She held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked . 
`` Imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said . 
They both laughed and winked back . 
`` I'm General Burnside's horse , upside down '' , Arlene said , sort of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position . 
She made General Burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down . 
Then , she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) . 
And she would wink and throw kisses . 
They both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble . 
But they kept on clapping for a long , long time . 
`` This time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing . 
It all has something to do with General Burnside and his horse '' . 
This time , it was so grand ; ; 
they could tell exactly what it was . 
It was General Burnside's horse running in a circle . 
His legs shook , and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders . 
`` That's the General's horse '' , one of them cried out . 
The other remarked , in a happy laughter , `` That's a funny old horse '' . 
The first one said , `` He sure does shake . 
He's old '' . 
Then there was the General kissing his wife . 
They had to be told that one . 
But it was even funnier after they had been told . 
Their father , when he came back from those many business trips , just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox . 
But not General Burnside . 
He was the funniest man . 
He never could keep still , even when he didn't move his feet . 
Then , they had to get up and be General Burnside . 
Or his horse . 
All they could think of was to run around in circles , kicking their legs out . 
It wasn't very funny . 
Then , they said General Burnside was going to jump over his horse's head ; ; 
and they did some somersaults . 
But that wasn't very funny , either . 
`` You ought to shake '' , Arlene advised them . 
And Arlene showed them how to begin . 
She also taught them to sing `` I wish I could shimmy like my sister Kate '' . 
That helped a lot . 
They were clumsy , but they were beginning to catch on . 
They also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling . 
`` Imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling -- or smiling with your lips trembling too much '' , Arlene suggested . 
That helped a great deal . 
They were a little late in getting home . 
`` I'm sorry , Mrs. Minks '' , Arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it . 
My mother constituted herself the voice of all of us . 
`` It's perfectly understandable , Arlene '' , my mother said in a friendly way . 
`` I suppose you all were playing and forgot '' ? ? 
`` Yes , ma'am '' , the children chorused heartily . 
We couldn't help laughing . 
The children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters ; ; 
and Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open . 
`` Arlene's a good girl '' , my uncle remarked to us ; ; 
but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded . 
That tap had a slight bangish quality . 
`` She really is a dear little thing '' , my mother agreed . 
Her upper lip lifted slightly . 
She was biting into a small red radish ; ; 
and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing . 
Also , she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat , mean little heap at the white center of the radish . 
She would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting . 
It never worked , naturally ; ; 
but it made her look unusual . 
Also , when she had bitten off half of the small radish , she found the suspense unbearable ; ; 
and she would snatch the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it . 
One could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh of relief . 
Actually , it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it . 
But the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public . 
Later on , the children told her further about somersaulting . 
`` It must be awfully good for them . 
And awfully kind of Arlene '' , she told us later . 
`` But do you know something curious '' ? ? 
She added . 
`` I reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress . 
I have no notion why I reached . 
And I found a radish . 
Was it an omen ? ? 
I thought for a second . 
But I would not pamper myself in that silly way . 
I opened the window and threw the radish out '' . 
Then , my mother blushed at this small lie ; ; 
for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain . 
Arlene became indispensable ; ; 
nobody could have told why . 
But she was . 
It was in the air . 
A friend of my father's came to dinner . 
He was passing through town and phoned to say hello . 
As a result , he was persuaded out to dinner . 
As a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months . 
Sometimes , he coincided with my father's being at home . 
Sometimes , as at this juncture , he did not . 
But he was always persuaded out . 
He liked children , in a loathsome kind of way ; ; 
the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment . 
When he had left , I could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles , laughingly , with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action , not bothering to look . 
The children loathed him , too . 
This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast room , with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them . 
There had been some coconut in it , for I remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a shiver . 
They were pushed gently into the room by Arlene -- whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door . 
We had just sat down . 
`` Tell Mr. Gorboduc what you're doing these days '' , my mother advised the children , ceremonially . 
There was an air of revolt about the children -- even irreverence for their own principles . 
This could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing , a horselike balkiness of demeanor . 
Possibly , the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration . 
But , at the beginning , this stayed just in the air . 
`` We go to the park with this nice lady '' , one of them said . 
`` We have good times '' . 
This happy bulletin convulsed Mr. Gorboduc . 
`` You do '' ? ? 
He asked , between wheezes of laughter . 
He was forced to wipe his eyes . 
`` You don't step on the flowers , do you ? ? 
Eh '' ? ? 
One of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger . 
`` No '' , he said . 
`` We don't '' . 
Mr. Gorboduc took a swig of his sherry . 
He was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs . 
Usually , this was done when attention was diverted by someone else's long , boring story . 
But this time she was nervous : she was open . 
Mr. Gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again . 
`` Tell me -- what do you do at the park '' ? ? 
He asked . 
This was delivered in a forthright way , without coyness and over-pretended interest -- an admirable way with children . 
Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command . 
This nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth , a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people , but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment . 
`` We bump '' , one said ; ; 
and the other went on to development of the idea . 
`` We grind , too '' , he said . 
My mother was beside herself with curiosity . 
`` Say that again '' , she pleaded . 
She laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass . 
`` You what '' ? ? 
She could see that Mr. Gorboduc was intrigued ; ; 
the hostess in her took over . 
She was rollickingly happy . 
`` You what '' ? ? 
My uncle looked at Mr. Gorboduc . 
He read Henry James and used to pretend profundity through eye-beamings at people . 
Mr. Gorboduc looked down . 
He would not look up . 
He was very funny about the whole thing . 
Pueri aquam de silvas ad agricolas portant , a delightful vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre-Punic War Rome . 
Marcellus , the hero , is beset from all sides by the problems of approaching manhood . 
The story opens on the eve of his fifty-third birthday , as he prepares for the two weeks of festivities that are to follow . 
Suddenly , a messenger arrives and , just before collapsing dead at his feet , informs him that the Saracens have invaded Silesia , the home province of his affianced . 
He at once cancels the celebrations and , buckling on his scimitar , stumbles blindly from the house , where he is hit and killed by a passing oxcart . 
The Albany Civic Opera's presentation of Spumoni's immortal Il Sevigli del Spegititgninino , with guest contralto Hattie Sforzt . 
An unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of Prometheus from the rock by the U.S. Cavalry was given last week in the warehouse of the Albany Leather Conduit Company amid cheers of `` Hubba hubba '' and `` Yalagaloo pip pip '' ! ! 
After a `` busy '' overture , the curtain rises on a farm scene -- the Ranavan Valley in northern Maine . 
A dead armadillo , the sole occupant of the stage , symbolizes the crisis and destruction of the Old Order . 
Old Order , acted and atonally sung by Grunnfeu Arapacis , the lovely Serbantian import , then entered and delivered the well-known invocation to the god Phineoppus , whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering Gorshek priests , symbolizing Love , Lust , Prudence and General Motors , respectively . 
According to the myth , Old Order then vanishes at stage left and reappears at extreme stage right , but Director Shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply having Miss Arapacis walk across the stage . 
The night he saw it , a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo , complaining -- in ad-lib -- that `` it smelled '' . 
We caught the early train to New York . 
The Dharma Dictionary , a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with Eurasian proto-senility cults . 
It's somewhat off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety and charm . 
For example , probably very few people know that the word `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate . 
Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news that such unlikely synonyms as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-birifw- '' all originated in the same village in Bathar-on-Walli Province and are all used to express sentiments concerning British `` imperialism '' . 
The terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean , but before you start spouting them to your date , it might be best to find out if he was a member of Major Pockmanster's Delhi Regiment , since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in that outfit . 
The breeze and chancellor Neitzbohr , a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a West German politician to woo a plaster cast of the Apollo Belvedere . 
As you have doubtless guessed already , the plot is plastered with Freudian , Jungian , and Meinckian theory . 
For example , when the film is only four minutes old , Neitzbohr refers to a small , Victorian piano stool as `` Wilhelmina '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name , of course , was Doris ( the English equivalent , when passed through middle-Gaelic derivations , of Wilhelmina ) . 
For the remainder of the movie , Chancellor Neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a Venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag . 
In this manner , he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against the English at Dunkirk . 
As we find out at the end , it is not the stool ( symbolizing Doris , therefore the English ) that he is punishing but the piece of Venetian blind . 
And , when the slat finally shatters , we see him count the fragments , all the while muttering , `` He loves me , he loves me not '' . 
After a few tortuous moments of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue , and we realize that Neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture . 
The effect , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at times a bit obscure , the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the `` repressed '' movie-goer . 
The music of Bini SalFininistas , capital LP Ab63711-r , one of the rare recordings of this titanic , yet unsung , composer . 
Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return to public notice ; ; 
and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed through his `` purgatory '' of neglect . 
But now , under the guidance of the contemporary composer Marc Schlek , Jr. , a major revival is under way . 
As he leads the Neurenschatz Skolkau Orchestra , Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut concertos , including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza , which was included at the conductor's insistence . 
A major portion of the credit should also go to flautist Haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis '' movement in the Baslot . 
Not only was Haumd's intonation and phrasing without flaw , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride . 
For example , to move ( as the score requires ) from the lowest F-major register up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds , not skipping , at the same time , even one of the 407 fingerings , seems a feat too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage . 
We would have preferred , however , to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance . 
As Broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas , the American theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance in that nebulous area known as `` off-Broadway '' . 
For the last two years , this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called `` non-dramas '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer . 
The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is The , an adaptation of Basho's classic frog-haiku by Roger Entwhistle , a former University of Maryland chemistry instructor . 
Although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness ( there are eleven acts varying in length from twenty-five seconds to an hour and a half ) , the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention . 
The action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee . 
They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress , the police , and an intruding government tutor . 
The innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie , gets a plate of English muffins instead . 
Leaving the theatre after the performance , I had a flash of intuition that life , after all ( as Rilke said ) , is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the American theatre since Brooks Atkinson retired . 
Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant terrible Francoisette Lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris again , this time with a sexy ballet scenario called The Lascivious Interlude , the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel . 
A biting , pithy parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life , the piece has been set by Mlle Lagoon to a sumptuous score ( a single motif played over and over by four thousand French horns ) by existentialist hot-shot Jean-Paul Sartre . 
Petite , lovely Yvette Chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly . 
Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born Free , there have been a lot of books about animals , but few compare with Max Fink's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My Friend , the Quizzical Salamander . 
Done in the modern style of a `` confession '' , Fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother's pet salamander , Alicia . 
It is not an entirely happy book , as Mrs. Fink soon becomes jealous of Alicia and , in retaliation , refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass . 
Max , in a fit of despair , takes Alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in Burbank ( Fink calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days in my whole life '' ) , at the end of which Alicia tragically contracts Parkinson's disease and dies . 
This brief resume hardly does the book justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time . 
Opera in the Grand Tradition , along with mah-jongg , seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback . 
In this country , the two guiding lights are , without doubt , Felix Fing and Anna Pulova . 
Fing , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for Sir Cedric Hardwicke , is responsible for the rediscovery of Verdi's earliest , most raucous opera , Nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the Mudugno version of `` Volare '' . 
Miss Pulova has a voice that Maria Callas once described as `` like chipping teeth with a screw driver '' , and her round , opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of Rosalie . 
The Champs Elysees is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of France's beat-up beatnik jeunes filles . 
Cause of all this commotion : squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly Jean-Pierre Bravado , a Bogartian figure , who plays a sadistic , amoral , philosophic Tasti-Freeze salesman in old New-Waver Fredrico de Mille Rossilini's endlessly provocative film , A Sour Sponge . 
Bravado has been alternately described as `` a symbol of the new grandeur of France and myself '' ( De Gaulle ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob '' ! ! 
( Norman Mailer ) , but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity whenever he is on it . 
Soaring to stardom along with him , Margo Felicity Brighetti , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet , turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic . 
The battle of the drib-drool continues , but most of New York's knowing sophisticates of Abstract Expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of V ( for Vindication ) Day , September first , when Augustus Quasimodo's first one-man show opens at the Guggenheim . 
We have heard that after seeing Mr. Quasimodo's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement . 
And it is thought by many who think about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet , progressed through Kandinsky and the cubist Picasso , and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De Kooning . 
Quasimodo defines his own art as `` the search for what is not there '' . 
`` I paint the nothing '' , he said once to Franz Kline and myself , `` the nothing that is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit ' of the moment resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon , in non-time '' . 
It is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as `` The Invasion of Cuba '' . 
In this work , his use of non-color is startling and skillful . 
The sweep of space , the delicate counterbalance of the white masses , the over-all completeness and unity , the originality and imagination , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece . 
I asked Quasimodo recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model `` a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity . 
Dear Sirs : Let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds , wherever you are . 
The collective by which I address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves . 
It is , I am reliably given to understand , the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost ; ; 
i.e. , burglars who rob while the tenants are absent , in contrast to hot-slough prowlers , those who work while the occupants are home . 
Since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior . 
Far from it ; ; 
I merely draw an etymological distinction , hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman . 
Above all , disabuse yourselves of any thought that I propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence , to whimper over the loss of a few objets d'art , or to shame you into rectitude . 
My object , rather , is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you , far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict . 
You have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them . 
Quite candidly , fellows , I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the rice in China . 
As you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations , permit me to recapitulate them briefly . 
Sometime on Saturday evening , August 22nd , while my family and I were dining at the Hostaria dell' Orso , in Rome , you jimmied a window of our home in Bucks County , Pennsylvania , and let yourselves into the premises . 
Hastening to the attic , the temperature of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast , you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet , some khaki pants , and the like , and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there . 
What you were looking for ( unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak Victrola . 
You danced two tangos and a paso doble , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu . 
You then descended one story , glommed a television set from the music room -- the only constructive feature of your visit , by the way -- and , returning to the ground floor , entered the master bedroom . 
From the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory , metal , wood , and stone sculptures of Oriental and African origin , two snuffboxes , and a jade-handled magnifying glass . 
Rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess set in ivory and sandalwood , which , along with two box Kodaks , you added to your haul . 
Then , having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on , you lammed out the front door , considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover . 
So much for the tiresome facts , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake . 
The foregoing , aided by several clues I'll withhold to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of Inspector Javert , but before they close in , gird yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless . 
Fourteen of the sculptures you took possess properties of a most curious and terrifying nature , as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches . 
In time , these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia , the king's evil , sheep rot , and clonic spasm , until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release . 
All this , though , is simply a prelude , a curtain-raiser , for what ensues , and I doubt whether any Occidental could accurately forecast it . 
If , however , it would help to intensify your anguish , I can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance . 
Hold on tight . 
First of all , the six figures of the Buddha you heisted -- four Siamese heads , a black obsidian statuette in the earth-touching position , and a large brass figure of the Dying Buddha on a teakwood base . 
Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief that the Lord Buddha is the most compassionate of the gods , much more so than Jehovah and Allah and the rest . 
'fess up -- don't you ? ? 
Well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the Wheel of the Law specifies ) toward impious folk who steal , disturb , or maltreat the Presence . 
Very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers . 
Eight or ten years ago , a couple of French hoods stole a priceless Khmer head from the Musee Guimet , in Paris , and a week later crawled into the Salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy . 
Hell's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment ; ; 
they expired amid indescribable fantods , imploring the Blessed One to forgive their desecration . 
Any reputable French interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances , and I'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience , but , for the moment , let's resume our catalogue . 
Whether the pair of Sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead , as a dealer in Khartoum assured me , I am not competent to say . 
Likewise the ivory Chinese female figure known as a `` doctor lady '' ( provenance Honan ) ; ; 
a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer , but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack . 
The three Indian brass deities , though -- Ganessa , Siva , and Krishna -- are an altogether different cup of tea . 
They hail from Travancore , a state in the subcontinent where Kali , the goddess of death , is worshiped . 
Have you ever heard of Thuggee ? ? 
Nuf sed . 
But it is the wooden sculpture from Bali , the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish , that I particularly call to your attention . 
Oddly enough , this is an amulet against housebreakers , presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949 . 
Inscribed around its base is a charm in Balinese , a dialect I take it you don't comprehend . 
Neither do I , but the Tjokorda Agoeng was good enough to translate , and I'll do as much for you . 
Whosoever violates our rooftree , the legend states , can expect maximal sorrow . 
The teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles , his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers , and a trolley car will grow in his stomach . 
Furthermore -- and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note -- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot . 
The cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation . 
Sort of remorseless , isn't it ? ? 
Still , there it is . 
Now , you no doubt regard the preceding as pap ; ; 
you're tooling around full of gage in your hot rods , gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like Ubermenschen . 
In that case , listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss . 
A couple of years back , I occupied a Village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a `` coffin turn '' . 
In it was a stone Tibetan Buddha I had picked up in Bombay , and occasionally , to make merit , my wife and I garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap . 
After a while , we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it . 
Our suspicions eventually centered , by the process of elimination , on a grocer's boy , a thoroughly bad hat , who delivered cartons to the people overhead . 
The more I probed into this young man's activities and character , the less savory I found him . 
I learned , for example , that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and , in winter , of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet . 
His energy was prodigious ; ; 
sometimes he would be up before dawn , clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx Zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws . 
Evenings , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like Enrico & Paglieri's or Peter's Backyard drunkenly donning ladies' hats and singing `` O Sole Mio '' . 
In short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase , slash timber . 
Well , the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn't retaliate , and in due course , as was inevitable , overreached himself . 
One morning , we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap . 
`` Now he's bought it '' , said my wife contentedly . 
`` No divinity will hold still for that . 
He's really asking for it '' . 
And how right she was . 
The next time we saw him , he was a changed person ; ; 
he had aged thirty years , and his face , the color of tallow , was crisscrossed with wrinkles , as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire . 
Some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps , he told us in a quavering voice -- either an ape specter or Abe Spector , a process-server , we couldn't determine which . 
His eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as Dr. Grimesby Roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band . 
The grocery the youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi , and let him go . 
The beautiful , the satisfying part of his disintegration , however , was the masterly way the Buddha polished him off . 
Reduced to beggary , he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer . 
His hubris , deficiency of taste , and sadism carried him straightaway to the top . 
He evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks , and quickly superseded his boss . 
Not long ago , I rode down with him in an elevator in Radio City ; ; 
he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once , clearly a man in extremis . 
`` See that guy '' ? ? 
The operator asked pityingly . 
`` I wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in China . 
There's some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps '' . 
However one looks at it , therefore , I'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy . 
The inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be easy to move ; ; 
you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva . 
Additionally , since you're going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue , yaws , Delhi boil , the Granville wilt , liver fluke , bilharziasis , and a host of other complications of the hex you've aroused , you mustn't expect to be lionized socially . 
My advice , if you live long enough to continue your vocation , is that the next time you're attracted by the exotic , pass it up -- it's nothing but a headache . 
As you can count on me to do the same . 
Compassionately yours , 
S. J. Perelman 
revulsion in the desert 
the doors of the D train slid shut , and as I dropped into a seat and , exhaling , looked up across the aisle , the whole aviary in my head burst into song . 
She was a living doll and no mistake -- the blue-black bang , the wide cheekbones , olive-flushed , that betrayed the Cherokee strain in her Midwestern lineage , and the mouth whose only fault , in the novelist's carping phrase , was that the lower lip was a trifle too voluptuous . 
From what I was able to gauge in a swift , greedy glance , the figure inside the coral-colored boucle dress was stupefying .
